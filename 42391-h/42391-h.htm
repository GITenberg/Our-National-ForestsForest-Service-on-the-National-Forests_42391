<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>Forestry is a vast subject. It has to do with
farm and forest, soil and climate, man and beast.
It affects hill and valley, mountain and plain. It
influences the life of cities, states, and nations.
It deals not only with the manifold problems of
growing timber and forest by-products, such as
forage, naval stores, tanbark, and maple sugar, but
it is intimately related to the navigability of rivers
and harbors, the flow of streams, the erosion of hillsides,
the destruction of fertile farm lands, the
devastation wrought by floods, the game and birds
of the forest, the public health, and national prosperity.</p>

<p>The practice of forestry has, therefore, become
an important part in the household economy of
civilized nations. Every nation has learned,
through the misuse of its forest resources, that forest
destruction is followed by timber famines,
floods, and erosion. Mills and factories depending
upon a regular stream flow must close down, or use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
other means for securing their power, which usually
are more expensive. Floods, besides doing enormous
damage, cover fertile bottom-lands with
gravel, bowlders, and débris, which ruins these
lands beyond redemption. The birds, fish, and
game, which dwell in the forests, disappear with
them. Springs dry up and a luxurious, well-watered
country becomes a veritable desert. In
short, the disappearance of the forests means the
disappearance of everything in civilization that is
worth while.</p>

<p>These are the lessons that some of the world's
greatest nations have learned, in some cases through
sad experience. The French people, after neglecting
their forests, following the French Revolution,
paid the penalty. France, through her reckless
cutting in the mountain forests, has suffered and is
still suffering from devastating floods on the Seine
and other streams. Over one million acres were
cut over in the mountains, and the slash and young
growth that was left was destroyed by fire. As a
result of this forest destruction the fertility of over
8,000,000 acres of tillable land was destroyed and
the population of eighteen departments was impoverished
or driven out. Now, although over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
$40,000,000 has been expended, only a very small
part of the damage has been repaired.</p>

<p>Our own country has learned from its own experiences
and from the experiences of nations like
France. On a small scale we have endured the
same devastating floods. Forest fires in the
United States have caused an average annual loss
of seventy human lives and from $25,000,000 to
$50,000,000 worth of timber. The indirect losses
run close to a half a billion a year. Like other nations,
we have come to the conclusion that forest
conservation can be assured only through the public
ownership of forest resources. Other nations have
bought or otherwise acquired national, state, and
municipal forests, to assure the people a never-failing
supply of timber. For this reason, mainly,
our own National Forests have been created and
maintained.</p>

<p>The ever-increasing importance of the forestry
movement in this country, which brings with it an
ever-increasing desire for information along forestry
lines, has led me to prepare this volume dealing
with our National Forests. To a large extent
I write from my own experience, having come in
contact with the federal forestry movement for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
more than ten years. My connection with the
United States Forest Service in various parts of
the West has given me ample opportunity to study
every phase of the problem. I am attempting to
chronicle a wonderful accomplishment by a wonderful
organization of altruistic Americans,&mdash;an accomplishment
of which every American has reason
to feel proud.</p>

<p>Few people realize that the bringing under administration
and protection of these vast forests is
one of the greatest achievements in the history of
forest conservation. To place 155,000,000 acres of
inaccessible, mountainous, forest land, scattered
through our great western mountain ranges and in
eighteen Western States, under administration, to
manage these forests according to scientific forestry
principles, to make them yield a revenue of almost
$3,500,000 annually, and to protect them from the
ravages of forest fires and reducing the huge annual
loss to but a small fraction of what it was
before&mdash;these are some of the things that have been
accomplished by the United States Forest Service
within the last twenty years.</p>

<p>Not only is this a great achievement in itself, but
few people realize what the solution of the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Forest problem has meant to the millions of people
who live near them; what it has meant to bring
civilization to the great forested empire of Uncle
Sam; what it has meant to change from a condition
of unrestricted, unregulated misuse with respect to
the public domain, to a policy of wise, regulated
use, based upon the principle of the greatest good
to the greatest number in the long run. In the
early days before the Forest Service organization
became established, the people were said to have
"shot-gun titles" to timber or grazing lands on the
public domain, and "might made right" in the truest
sense of the word. This crude condition of
affairs gave way to wise, conservative use under
government control. Just as the farmer each year
sets aside a certain amount of his seed for next
year's planting, just so the stockman saves his
calves and cows and lambs for greater growth and
each year sees a part of his herd maturing for market,
and just so the forester, under the new system,
cuts only the mature trees and allows the young
timber to remain for greater growth and greater
value in the future, or, in the absence of young
trees, plants small trees to replace those removed.</p>

<p>The people of the West are convinced that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
great work has been done well and wisely. The
people of the Eastern States will soon realize that
a similar forest policy, already inaugurated in the
Appalachian and White Mountains, will mean
every bit as much to them.</p>

<p>If I succeed only in a small degree to make my
reader appreciate the great significance of the National
Forest movement to our national economy,
I will feel amply repaid for the time spent in preparing
this brief statement. I am indebted to the
Forest Service for many valuable illustrations used
with the text, and for data and other valuable assistance.
To all those who have aided in the preparation
of this volume, by reading the manuscript or
otherwise, I extend my sincere thanks. I am especially
grateful to Mr. Herbert A. Smith and others
of the Washington office of the Forest Service for
having critically read the manuscript and for having
offered valuable suggestions.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<h3>FORESTRY AS A NATIONAL PROBLEM</h3>

<p>The forest problem is, both locally and nationally,
of vital internal importance. Not only is
wood&mdash;the chief product of the forest&mdash;indispensable
to our daily life, but the forest plays an important
rôle in regulating stream flow, thereby reducing
the severity of floods and preventing erosion.
For these reasons the preservation of forests
ceases to be a problem of private or individual concern,
but forthwith becomes a governmental problem,
or, at best, an enterprise which should be
jointly controlled by the National Government and
the individual States.</p>

<p><i>Our Consumption of Wood.</i> It is often said
that wood enters into our daily life from the time
we are born until we die&mdash;from the cradle to the
coffin. It is difficult to imagine a civilization without
wood. In our country in a single year we use
90,000,000 cords of firewood, nearly 40,000,000,000
feet of lumber, 150,000,000 railroad ties, nearly
1,700,000,000 barrel staves, 445,000,000 board feet
of veneer, over 135,000,000 sets of barrel headings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
over 350,000,000 barrel hoops, over 3,300,000 cords
of native pulp wood, 170,000,000 cubic feet of round
mine timbers, nearly 1,500,000 cords of wood for
distillation, over 140,000 cords for excelsior, and
nearly 3,500,000 telephone and telegraph poles.
In short, we take from our forests yearly, including
waste in logging and manufacture, more than
twenty-two billion cubic feet of wood valued at
about $1,375,000,000. This is enough lumber to
construct seven board walks twenty-five feet wide
from the earth to the moon, a distance of about
240,000 miles, or a board walk one-third of a mile
wide completely around the earth at the equator.
These figures give a little idea of the enormous
annual drainage upon the forests of the United
States and immediately suggest an important reason
that led to the establishment of our National
Forests.</p>

<p><i>The Lumber Industry.</i> Measured by the number
of persons employed, lumbering is the country's
largest manufacturing industry. In its 48,000
saw mills it employs more than 600,000 men.
Its investment in these plants is over $1,000,000,000,
and the investment in standing timber
is $1,500,000,000 more. This industry furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the railroads a traffic income of over $200,000,000
annually. If we include in these statistics
also the derived wood products, we find that over
1,000,000 wage earners are employed, and that the
products and derived products are valued at over
$2,000,000,000 annually. Most certainly we are
dealing with a very large business enterprise.</p>

<p><i>Our Future Lumber Supply.</i> You may ask,
"What effect have the great annual consumption of
wood and these large business interests upon the
future supply of wood?" The most reliable statistics
show that out of 5,200 billion feet of merchantable
timber which we once possessed, only
2,900 billion feet are left. In other words, almost
half of our original supply of timber has been used.
Besides, the present rate of cutting for all purposes
exceeds the annual growth of the forests. Even
the annual growth is considered by many experts
of unknown quantity and quality, to some extent
offset by decay in virgin forests. The only logical
conclusion to draw from this condition of affairs, if
the present rate of consumption continues, is a timber
shortage in so far as our most valuable woods
are concerned. In view of this it is fortunate that
the National Government began to control the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
lumber and forest situation by the creation of
National Forests and the institution of scientific
forestry practice.</p>

<p><i>Forests and Stream Flow.</i> But the forests not
only supply us with wood. For other reasons they
deserve governmental consideration. The forests
in the mountains control our streams, vitally affect
the industries depending upon water power, reduce
the severity of floods and erosion, and in this way
are intimately wrapped up with our great agricultural
interests. For this reason forestry is by nature
less suited for private enterprise. In agriculture
and horticulture the influence of the farm or
the fruit crop rarely extends beyond the owner's
fence. What I plant in my field does not affect
my neighbors; they share neither in my success or
failure. If by the use of poor methods I ruin the
fertility of my farm, this fact does not influence
the fertility of my neighbor's fields. But in forestry
it is different. Unfortunately, just as the
sins of the fathers are visited upon their children,
so the sins of the mountains are visited upon the
valleys.</p>

into one body in some of the well-known Eastern States.
</div></div>

<p>The mountainous slopes of the Appalachian
ranges and the steep, broken, granite ridges of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
Rockies, the Sierras, and the Cascades are the sites
most suited in our country for forestry purposes.
The Appalachian ranges have been affected most
by the reckless cutting of forests. When these
mountains were clothed with forests, the rivers ran
bank full, ships came to the harbors at low tide with
ease, and factories and cotton-mills ran steadily all
year long. Since the destruction of these forests
the surrounding country has suffered from alternate
floods and droughts; great manufacturing centers
have lost their steady supply of water; harbors
are filled with silt from the mountain sides; and
fields, once fertile, are covered with sand, gravel,
and débris, deposited by the ungovernable stream.
These forests belonged to private individuals who
disposed of the timber and pocketed all the profits,
while the community below suffered all the loss.
In other words, private ownership is inadequate
since private interest and private responsibility are
not sufficiently far-reaching and far-sighted.</p>

<p><i>Forests and Erosion.</i> Erosion is one of the most
serious dangers that threaten our farms both by
transporting fertile soil and by covering the bottom-lands
with sand, gravel, and débris. Since we are
largely an agricultural people, the importance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
this problem will be readily appreciated. Over 50
per cent. of our population is rural, and the annual
production of farm crops has a value of over $5,500,000,000.
Farm uplands are washed away or
eroded by high water, and high water is largely
caused by the destruction of the forests on the
mountain slopes. With the forest cover removed,
there is nothing to obstruct the flow of water down
the mountain sides. Raindrops beating on the
bare soil make it hard and compact so that most of
the water runs off instead of being absorbed by the
subsoil, with the result that a heavy rain storm
rushes down through the valleys in a few days instead
of a few weeks, tears out the river banks,
floods the lowlands, and deposits upon them the
rocks and gravel carried down from the mountains.
The most effective means for preventing the erosion
and destruction of our farmlands is by the wise use
of the forests at the headwaters of the rivers.</p>

<p><i>Forestry a Public Enterprise.</i> From what has
been said it will be seen that forestry is a national
business rather than an individual's. Moreover, it
is of such a protracted nature, reaching continuously
into such long periods of time, demanding so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
many years of time and patience to see the expected
and promised results, that an individual would not
live to see the success of his labors. The individual
becomes easily discouraged and is especially affected
by financial conditions. The Government, on the
other hand, having unlimited resources at its command
can more readily afford to wait for results.
In fact every consideration of national welfare
urges the Government to carry it on; it is a sure
source of revenue, there is none less fluctuating, and
it is closely connected with the manifold industries
of life. Its chief product is wood, without which
the human race, so far, has not succeeded in managing
its affairs, and which will therefore always have
a sale value.</p>

<h3>THE EXTENT AND CHARACTER OF OUR NATIONAL FORESTS</h3>

<p><i>How the Government Obtained the National
Forest Lands.</i> Probably the first question that will
occur to my reader concerning the National Forests
is, How did the Government acquire them? To
answer this question we have but to turn back the
pages of history to the close of the Revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
War. Following this war, our country started on
its career of continental conquest. This conquest
was largely a peaceful one because most of the western
country was acquired by treaty or purchase,
thus: Louisiana Territory was purchased from
France in 1803; Texas applied for admission into
the Union in 1845; Oregon Territory was acquired
by treaty from Great Britain in 1846; the present
states of California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico,
and Arizona were ceded to us as a result of the
Mexican War in 1848; and the Gadsden Purchase
was obtained from Mexico in 1853 and added to
the territory of New Mexico. Then also Alaska
was finally purchased from Russia in 1867. These
large acquisitions, comprising together the western
two thirds of the United States, were gradually
divided into territories. Later they became States,
and were opened up to settlement and development
by means of various land and mining laws and large
railroad grants. The National Forests are composed
of the land most valuable for growing timber,
that has not been acquired in some way by private
individuals, in the western part of the United
States.</p>

<p><i>The Romance of the National Forest Region.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
This vast expanse west of the Mississippi River
boasts of some of the wildest and most romantic
scenery on the North American continent, and it is
in the heart of this picturesque country that the National
Forests are located. This is the country in
which Owen Wister, Harold Bell Wright, Stewart
Edward White, Jack London, Theodore Roosevelt,
and other authors have gotten their inspirations
and laid their plots. To one who knows "The Virginian,"
or "When a Man's a Man," or "The Winning
of Barbara Worth," or "The Valley of the
Moon," nothing more need be said. To others I
might say that my pen picture of that country is a
very poor and very inadequate method of description.
It is the land of the cow-puncher, the sheep-herder,
and the lumber-jack; a land of crude customs
and manners, but, withal, generous hospitality.
It is the country of the elk and the mule-tail deer,
the mountain lion and the rattlesnake. Its grandeur
makes you love it; its vastness makes you fear
it; yet there is an irresistible charm, a magic lure, an
indescribable something that stamps an indelible
impression upon the mind and that makes you want
to go back there after you have sworn an oath never
to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
This National Forest empire presents a great variety
of scenery, of forest, and of topography. The
beautiful white pine forests of Idaho and Montana,
the steep pine- and spruce-clad granite slopes of the
Colorado Rockies, and the sun-parched mesas of
the Southwest, with their open park-like forests of
yellow pine, all have their individual charm. And
after crossing the well-watered Cascades and Sierra
Nevadas we find forest scenery entirely different.
The dense, luxuriant, giant-forests of the coast region
of Oregon and Washington, bathed in an almost
continual fog and rain, are without doubt the
most wonderful forests in the world. And lastly,
California, so far as variety of forest scenery is concerned,
has absolutely no rival. The open oak
groves of the great valleys, the arid pine- and oak-covered
foothills, the valuable sugar pine and "big-tree"
groves of the moist mountain slopes, and the
dwarfed pine and hemlock forests near the serrated
crest of the Sierras, all occur within a comparatively
short distance of each other, and, in fact, may be
seen in less than a day on any one of the many
National Forests in these mountains.</p>

<p><i>Famous Scenic Wonders Near the Forests.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
Many of the beautiful National Parks that have
been created by Congress are either entirely or
partly surrounded by one or more of the National
Forests. These parks are a Mecca to which hundreds
of thousands of our people make their annual
pilgrimage. Most of these parks are already famous
for their scenery, and, in consequence, the
National Forests surrounding them have received
greater patronage and fame. The Glacier National
Park in Montana, the Yellowstone in Wyoming,
the Rocky Mountain in Colorado, the
Mount Rainier in Washington, the Crater Lake in
Oregon, the Wind Cave in South Dakota, and the
Lassen Peak Volcanic Park, the Yosemite, General
Grant, and Sequoia parks in California, are all situated
in the heart of the National Forest region.</p>

<p>The highest and best-known mountain peaks in
the United States are either located within or situated
near the National Forests, as, for example,
Rainier and Olympus in Washington; Hood,
Baker, St. Helens, Jefferson, and Adams in Oregon;
Shasta, Lassen, and Whitney in California;
and Pikes Peak in Colorado.</p>

<p>Then there are the National Monuments, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
which there are eleven, all situated within one or
more of the National Forests. These were created
under an act of Congress for the preservation of
objects of historic or scientific interest. The largest
monument, and no doubt the most famous, is
the Grand Canyon National Monument located in
the Tusayan and Kaibab National Forests in Arizona,
comprising over 800,000 acres. The next
largest is the Mount Olympus Monument on the
Olympic National Forest in Washington, comprising
almost 300,000 acres. Other well-known monuments
are the Cinder Cone and the Lassen Peak
Monuments on the Lassen National Forest in California,
and the Cliff Dwellings on the Gila National
Forest in New Mexico.</p>

<p><i>The Size and Extent of the National Forests.</i>
With this brief introduction of the nature of the
country in which the National Forests are located,
the reader will be interested to know something of
the size of the Forests and their total area. The
total area varies slightly from time to time, due to
the addition of lands that have been found to have
value for forestry purposes, or to the elimination of
lands found to be chiefly valuable for agricultural
use. On June 30, 1917, there were 147 National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
Forests with a total of 155,166,619 acres. Thus
the average National Forest comprises about one
million acres of government lands. The many
private holdings scattered through the Forests make
the average gross area of each Forest much greater.
These Forests are located in Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Michigan,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Porto Rico, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and
Wyoming. Besides these Forests there have been
acquired or approved for purchase under the Weeks
Law over 1,500,000 acres in the States of Georgia,
Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.
These lands are now under protection and will
gradually be consolidated into National Forests.
More lands are constantly being acquired in the
Eastern States in accordance with the Weeks Law.</p>

<p>Few people have any conception of what a gigantic
empire the National Forest domain is. If consolidated
into one large compact area, the 155 million
acres of National Forests would cover an area
larger than the combined areas of thirteen well-known
Eastern States, viz.: Maine, Vermont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and West
Virginia (see map). This area is also one fifth
larger than the entire area of France. We marvel
sometimes at the ability of a ruler to rule a country
as large as France or Germany; why should we
Americans not marvel at the ability of the man
who practically rules over our National Forests,
who keeps in perfect working order the great organization
which protects and administrates the
Forests?</p>

<p><i>The Topography and Climate of the National
Forest Region.</i> The difficulty of the work of this
organization is at once apparent when we find that
these Forests are located in wild, rugged, mountainous
country, in most cases many miles from the
railroad and human habitations, such as towns and
cities. This country is usually far above sea level&mdash;the
average being between 3,000 and 8,000 feet
in altitude. But there are large areas in the National
Forests of Colorado that lie above 10,000 feet
elevation. Such country as this has a very severe
climate. The climate is usually too cold and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
growing seasons too short for the production of
crops such as wheat, corn, oats, potatoes, etc.
Therefore, practically all of this land is what the
forester calls "absolute forest land," that is, it is
better adapted for growing timber crops than any
other. Another important fact about the National
Forests is that they are located, for the most part,
on steep mountain slopes and at the headwaters of
mountain streams. This makes them of vital importance
in regulating the stream flow of our western
rivers. In fact it is no exaggeration to say that
all our large western rivers have their origin on
National Forest land.</p>

<h3>WHY THE NATIONAL FORESTS WERE CREATED</h3>

<p>Aside from the great economic reasons why a
nation should possess National Forests, there are
local reasons which pertain to the welfare of the
home builder and home industries which are often
of paramount importance. The timber, the water,
the pasture, the minerals, and all other resources on
the government lands in the West are for the use
of all the people. And only by a well-regulated
policy of sale or rental can these resources be disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
so as to give all individuals an equal opportunity
to enjoy them. These vast resources have
been estimated to have a value of over $2,000,000,000.
But their value to the local communities can
hardly be overestimated. The welfare of every
community is dependent upon a cheap and plentiful
supply of timber. If lumber, fence posts, mine
props, telephone poles, firewood, etc., must be
brought in from distant markets, the prices are
usually very much higher. The regulation of the
cut on each National Forest assures a never-failing
supply of timber to the home builder and to home
industries. Then also the permanence of the great
live stock industry is dependent upon a conservative
use of vast areas of government range. Local residents
are protected from unfair competition.
Lastly, the protection by the Forest Service of the
forest cover in the western mountains assures a
regular stream flow which is of vital importance
for power, irrigation, and domestic purposes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most comprehensive statement upon
the purposes of the National Forests and the methods
and general policy of administering them is to
be found in a letter by the Secretary of Agriculture
to the Forester, dated February 1, 1905, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
the Forests were turned over to the Department of
Agriculture:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the administration of the forest reserves it must be
clearly borne in mind that all land is to be devoted to its
most productive use for the permanent good of the whole
people, and not for the temporary benefit of individuals or
companies. All the resources of the forest reserves are for
<i>use</i>, and this use must be brought about in a thoroughly prompt
and businesslike manner, under such restrictions only as will
insure the permanence of these resources. The vital importance
of forest reserves to the great industries of the Western
States will be largely increased in the near future by
the continued steady advance in settlement and development.
The permanence of the resources of the reserves is
therefore indispensable to continued prosperity, and the policy
of this Department for their protection and use will invariably
be guided by this fact, bearing in mind that the <i>conservative
use</i> of these resources in no way conflicts with their
permanent value.</p>

<p>"You will see to it that the water, wood, and forage of
the reserves are conserved and wisely used for the benefit
of the home builder first of all, upon whom depends the best
permanent use of lands and resources alike. The continued
prosperity of the agricultural, lumbering, mining, and live-stock
interests is directly dependent upon a permanent and
accessible supply of water, wood, and forage, as well as upon
the present and future use of these resources under businesslike
regulations, enforced with promptness, effectiveness, and
common sense. In the management of each reserve local questions
will be decided upon local grounds; the dominant industry
will be considered first, but with as little restriction
to minor industries as may be possible; sudden changes in industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
conditions will be avoided by gradual adjustment
after due notice, and where conflicting interests must be
reconciled the question will always be decided from the standpoint
of the greatest good of the greatest number in the long
run."</p></blockquote>

<h3>HOW THE NATIONAL FOREST POLICY HAS BENEFITED THE PEOPLE</h3>

<p>This general policy, which was laid down by the
Secretary of Agriculture, has been followed out,
with the result that a great many benefits have
been derived by the nation as a whole, by the individual
States in which the National Forests are
located, and, lastly, by the local communities and
users of the Forests.</p>

<p><i>The Remaining Timber Resources Were Saved.</i>
First of all the timber, the forage, and the water-power
on the public domain has been reserved for
the whole people and not for a privileged few.
Before the Forest Reserve policy went into effect,
the most valuable timber was being withdrawn from
government ownership by the misuse of the public
land laws, whose purpose and intent were fraudulently
evaded. Many claims were initiated apparently
for the purpose of establishing a homestead
but in reality for the purposes of securing the timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
on the land and later to dispose of it to some
large timber holder. Every citizen is allowed to
exercise his homestead right. Big timber operators
would secure the services of many dummy locators,
pay the expenses of locating, improving, and perfecting
the patent, and then buy the claim from
these dummies for small sums. A large timber
holder in California secured his hundreds of thousands
of acres of timber land in this way. By instructing
these men where to locate their claims he
was able to secure more or less solid blocks of timber
made up originally of 160 acre patches. These
patches, which originally were bought by the lumber
barons for from $500 to $800 a claim, now have
a value of from $8,000 to as high as $20,000. The
people of the United States have lost the difference.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say where or how this wholesale
misuse of the public land laws would have ended
if it had not been for the inauguration of the National
Forest policy. Since the Government has
taken full charge of its forest domain, this misuse
has stopped. In fact many of the fraudulent
claims located years ago are being investigated, and
if they are found to have been initiated with intent
to defraud the Government, the land and the timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
is returned to the National Forest in which it is
located. To-day the National Forests contain
about one fifth of the standing timber in the United
States, an amount which will undoubtedly have a
great effect upon the supply of timber available
for future generations, especially since under present
lumbering methods the privately owned timber
lands are being practically destroyed, while the National
Forests are actually being improved by scientific
management. Four fifths of the standing
timber is privately owned, and this is usually of
much higher quality than the publicly owned timber.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>The Use of Forage and Water Resources Was
Regulated.</i> The forage and water resources of the
public domain have been subject to similar abuse.
Before the National Forest policy was put into
effect the large ranges of the West were used indiscriminately
by all. The range was subject to considerable
abuse because it was used very early in
the spring before the forage was mature, or too
late in the fall, which prevented the forage from
ripening its seed and reproducing for the next season.
Not the small, local stockmen, however, but
the large sheep and cattle companies, many controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
by foreign capital, benefited by this condition
of affairs. These "big men," as they were
called, illegally fenced and monopolized large areas,
varying in size from townships to entire counties.
What chance would a local rancher with fifty or
sixty cattle have against a million-dollar outfit with
perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 cattle? He was merely
swallowed up, so to speak, and had no chance whatever
to get his small share. "Might made right"
in those days, and it is said that if a man held any
title or equity on the range it was a "shotgun"
title. Also, the sheep and cattle men had innumerable
disputes about the use of the range which
in many cases resulted in bloodshed. If a sheep
man arrived first on the range in the spring with
his large bands of sheep, he simply took the feed.
The Government owned the land and the forage
but it had no organization in the field to regulate
the use of it. It was indeed a chaotic condition
of affairs and ended only after the inauguration
of the present policy of leasing the lands under the
permit system. These permits are issued and
charged for upon a per capita basis.</p>

<p>The conservative and regulated use of the grazing
lands under Forest Service supervision has resulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
in better growth and better weights on stock
and more actual profit. There are ample data that
show that the National Forests produce some of
the best lambs that are put upon the market. Data
secured from the Modoc National Forest, California,
in 1910, show that lambs brought 50 cents
per head more and weighed an average of 10
pounds more than lambs produced outside the Forest.
Weights taken of 10,000 head showed an average
of 72 pounds for National Forest lambs,
while outside the Forest average weights on 3,000
lambs showed only 62 pounds. The regulation of
the length of the grazing season, the introduction
of better methods of handling sheep, and the prevention
of over-grazing are some of the Forest
Service methods that produce better lambs.</p>

<p>Then also under the old system the valuable
water-power sites were being rapidly eliminated
from government ownership by large corporations
who secured valuable property for a song. The
National Forests, however, still contain about one-third
of the potential water-power resources of the
United States and over 40 per cent. of the estimated
power resources of the Western States.
And this vast wealth will not pass from the ownership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
of the United States but will be leased under
long-term leases from which the Government will
receive yearly a fair rental.</p>

<p><i>The Forests Were Protected from Fire and
Trespass.</i> But not only have these large timber,
forage, and power resources been put under administration
for the use of the people. The protection
of the National Forests, which goes hand in hand
with their administration, means a great deal to
the local communities, the States, and the nation as
a whole. Until about twenty years ago the forests
upon our public lands&mdash;the timber of the Rocky
Mountains from Montana to New Mexico and of
the Pacific Coast ranges from northern Washington
to southern California&mdash;seemed destined to
be destroyed by fire and reckless, illegal cutting.
Nothing whatever was being done to protect them
from fire or trespass. They were simply left to
burn. When the people living near the public domain
wanted any house logs, fence posts, or firewood,
they went into the public domain and took
them. The best trees were usually taken first. In
California, especially, there was a common practice
of cutting down the finest sugar pine trees and
cutting and splitting them into shakes to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
roof covering. Then, too, much government timber
was stolen by lumber companies operating in
the vicinity of valuable government timber. After
the land had been stripped of everything of value
a fire was started in the slashing, which among other
things burned the stumps and thus practically obliterated
all evidence of trespass. Had this destruction
continued there would to-day have been little
timber left in the West, and the development of
the country which demands timber all the time, and
not only at certain intervals, would have been retarded,
if not stopped altogether.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 6. A scene on one of the famous National Parks. Upper
Lake, Glacier National Park, Northern Rockies, Montana.
</div></div>

<p>How terrible the forest fires were in this western
country is well illustrated by what an old California
settler once told me, and what I have heard repeatedly
in many Western States. He said: "In
the years before the Forest Service took over the
care and protection of the forests around here, the
mountains within view of my ranch were not visible
for many months at a time, being almost continually
enveloped in smoke from the big forest fires
that were raging in the forests all summer without
ever being under control. They started in the
spring as soon as it became dry and were not suppressed
until the late fall rains and snows put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
out." But he added with great enthusiasm, "Since
the Service has taken charge the sky around here
is as clear as crystal all summer. I never see any
forest fires, not even smoke, because the Rangers
seem to get to them before they get to be of any
size." Such testimony as this speaks volumes for
the efficiency of the present system of protecting
the Forests from fire.</p>

<p><i>The Watershed Cover Was Preserved.</i> The destruction
of the forest cover on the watersheds
feeding thousands of streams which rise in the
western mountains would have had its bad effect
on stream flow&mdash;low water during the long dry
periods, and destructive floods after heavy rains.
This condition of affairs would have meant disaster
to the systems of irrigation by which most of
the western farmers raise their crops. It would
also have seriously impeded and in many cases
prevented electric power development, to say nothing
of affecting the domestic water of many of our
large western cities whose drinking water comes
from the streams rising in the National Forests.
The protection of these valuable watersheds
by the Forest Service from fire and destructive
lumbering is of such vital importance to the welfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
of the nation that it has been made one of the
main reasons for establishing National Forests.</p>

<p><i>Civilization Brought to the Mountains.</i> What
the National Forest movement has done for settling
and building up the Western States can hardly be
overestimated. It has brought civilization into the
wilderness. Roads, trails, telephone lines, and
other modern conveniences have been brought to
remote corners of the mountains. It has encouraged
the settlement of the country by calling attention
to the agricultural lands within the National
Forests. More important than that, it has assured
the West permanent towns, permanent civilization,
and not a temporary, careless, shiftless civilization
which vanishes with the exploitation of resources,
as it did under the old régime.</p>

<p>The improvements on the National Forests have
benefited not only the Forest officers for the administration
of the Forests. They have helped immensely
the local population. The pleasure resorts
as well as the business of the Forests have been
made more accessible. New trails have opened up
new and hitherto inaccessible country, where fishing,
hunting, and trapping are ideal. All the old and
new roads and trails have been well marked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
sign boards giving the tourist detailed information
about distances between the various points of interest.
Roads have opened up new regions to automobiles
and to the horse and wagon. In 1916 it
was estimated that more than 2,000,000 people visited
the National Forests for recreation and pleasure.
They came in automobiles, in horse and
wagon, on horseback, on mules, on burros, and in all
sorts of made-to-order contrivances, and the writer
has even seen those that could not afford anything
better, pack their camp outfits in a wheelbarrow and
push it before them in their effort to leave the hot,
dusty valleys below, and go to the refreshing and invigorating
Forests of Uncle Sam. In addition to
the large numbers of tourists that visit the National
Forests every year, over 100,000 persons or companies
use the National Forests. Of these a little
more than half are paid users, who are charged a
fair fee for timber, grazing, or other privileges and
a little less than half enjoy free use privileges.</p>

<p><i>Agricultural Lands Opened to Settlement.</i> The
settlement of the agricultural lands in the National
Forests is a matter that has received special attention
at the hands of the Forest Service in late years.
Land more valuable for agriculture than for timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
growing was excluded from the National Forests
before the boundaries were drawn, so far as this
was possible. Small tracts of agricultural land
within the Forests which could not be excluded are
opened to settlement under the Forest Homestead
Act of June 11, 1906. The amount of land, however,
that is more valuable for agriculture than for
timber is trifling, because the greater part of the
valuable land was already settled before the Forests
were created. The few small patches that are left
inside of the National Forest boundaries are rapidly
being classified and opened to entry for homesteads.
Much of the land apparently adapted for
agricultural purposes has a severe climate because
it lies at high altitudes and it is often remote from
roads, schools, villages, and markets. Therefore
the chance offered the prospective settler in the
immediate vicinity of the Forests is far better than
in the Forests themselves. The Forest Service is
doing everything it can to encourage homesteaders
on the National Forests; it wants them because they
help to report fires, help to fight fires, and in many
other ways assist the Forest officers.</p>

<p><i>Permanent and Not Temporary Civilization Resulted.</i>
Only those people who have been brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
up near a large lumbering center can appreciate
what it means when a town vanishes; when all that
is left of a thriving town of 5,000 or more souls is
empty streets, empty houses, and heaps of tin cans.
In the days of the Golden Age of lumbering in
Michigan many towns flourished in the midst of the
forests. These towns had thrifty, busy people,
with schools, churches, banks, and other conveniences.
These people were engaged in exploiting
the forests. The beautiful white pine forests were
converted into boards at the rate of thousands of
feet every day. When these magnificent forests
were laid low, the lumbermen left to seek virgin
timber elsewhere. They left behind them empty
towns and barren lands; only a few charred stumps
remained to show where the forests once stood.
But this is not an incident peculiar to the Golden
Age of lumbering in Michigan. Even to-day this
very thing is happening. The town of Crossfork,
Potter County, Pennsylvania, had a population of
over 2,500 souls in 1909. When the nearby timber
was exhausted, practically the whole town was
abandoned. In 1913 it had a population of 50.</p>

<p>In direct contrast to this short-sighted policy of
the State of Michigan (and many others also) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
the National Forest policy, which provides for a
future supply of forest products as well as a present
supply; which provides for work and homes and
schools and churches for future generations as well
as for the present; which provides for a permanent
industry and not one that vanishes with the exploitation
of the resources of a region as snow vanishes
under the warm rays of a spring day. Lumbering
even to-day is merely the removal of every
vestige of timber that has any sale value. But forestry,
which is practiced on the National Forests,
removes only the mature trees, leaving the young
growth to be cut at some future time. Lumbering
has been and is to-day forest destruction; forestry
is forest conservation under a system of wise use.
Lumbering is followed usually by fire, and often
by an entire impoverishment of the region in which
it is carried on because it destroys both the mature
tree and the young growth; under a system of forestry,
cutting is followed by young, green forests
which are protected from fire for the benefit of
future generations. Such a system leaves the region
and the industry in a permanent, good condition.
The county under the old system receives no
more taxes after its wealth is gone; but each county<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
will receive taxes or money in lieu of taxes every
year as long as the National Forests shall endure.</p>

<p><i>Financial Returns.</i> All the benefits of which
I have spoken are without doubt great assets to
the local community, to the State, and to the nation
as a whole. They are great contributions to
the welfare of our country even though they cannot be
measured in dollars and cents. This brings us then
to the financial aspect of the National Forest movement.
Even though the fundamental purpose of
the National Forests was in no sense a financial one,
it is interesting to look into the finances of this great
forestry enterprise.</p>

<p>The total regular appropriation for salaries, general
expenses, and improvements for the fiscal year
1918 is $5,712,275. For 1917 it was slightly less
than this: $5,574,735. The receipts from the sale
or rental of National Forest resources in the fiscal
year 1917 reached $3,457,028.41. From these figures
it will be seen that the expenditures exceed the
receipts by between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 a
year, depending partly on the severity of the fire
season and partly on the activity of the general
lumber market. When we consider that this is
really a newly established business scarcely twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
years old; that large expenditure have been made
and must necessarily be made every year for equipment
and improvements before the resources could
even be used; and that an efficient organization had
to be built up to handle the business, we must confess
that the receipts are really a wonderful showing.</p>

<p>When the Forest Reserves were taken over by
the Government it could not be expected that they
would yield a revenue at the very outset, nor could
it be expected that even in the long space of twenty-five
years they could be made self-supporting.
The reasons for this are many. They are located
for the most part in rugged, inaccessible mountains.
In the case of almost every Forest a great deal of
money had to be expended for roads, trails, telephone
lines, fences, bridges, ranger stations and
other cabins, lookout structures, fire lines, and
many other improvements before the resources
could even be used. Many of the resources were
practically locked up; there were no roads by which
to get them out of the wilderness. During the fiscal
year 1916 alone there were built 227 miles of
roads, 1,975 miles of trails, 2,124 miles of telephone
lines, 89 miles of fire lines, 81 lookout structures, 40<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
bridges, 222 miles of fences, 545 dwellings, barns,
and other structures, and many other improvements.
Up to date there have been constructed
over 3,000 miles of roads, over 25,000 miles of trails,
about 23,000 miles of telephone lines, 860 miles of
firebreaks, about 360 forest fire lookout cabins and
towers, and many other improvements. Their total
value is estimated at $7,000,000. And these
vast improvements are but a small percentage of
the improvements which will be necessary to be
able to put these Forests to their highest use.</p>

<p>Not only must enormous sums be spent for improvements.
The huge sums which are spent for
the protection of the great resources bring no tangible
return in dollars and cents; yet the fire protection
system prevents the destruction of millions of
dollars' worth of timber every year. Then again,
when government timber lands are cut over, only
the mature trees are taken; the smaller trees, although
they have a commercial value, are left on
the ground to mature because they will have a still
greater value in from forty to fifty years. This is
merely foregoing a small present revenue for a
larger future one. Also many National Forests
have on them large areas of steep mountain slopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
where not a stick of timber is allowed to be cut.
These areas are maintained intact for watershed
protection. In fact many of the Forests of southern
California are maintained solely for this purpose.
These Forests are covered almost entirely
by a low bush-like growth called "chaparral," which
has no value either as timber or as browse, but which
has great value to preserve an equable stream flow
for domestic use, irrigation, and water power.</p>

<p>But there are still other reasons why the cash
receipts from the National Forests are not as large
as they might be. In addition to the cash receipts
the equivalent of a large revenue is foregone every
year through the various forms of free use and the
sale of timber to settlers at cost instead of at its
actual cash value. During the fiscal year 1917 approximately
$150,000 worth of timber was given to
settlers free of cost. About 40,000 people were
served under this policy. Also much timber is sold
at cost to settlers for domestic use. In this way
over 4,400 persons received many millions of feet of
timber whose cost value was about $20,000, but
whose sale value was much greater. The privilege
of grazing a small number of stock free of charge
is granted to settlers living on or near the Forests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
The stock thus grazed amounts to about 125,000
animals every year. The Forests are also put to
many special uses for which no charge is made although
their administration involves some expense.
Strict accounting should credit the fair value of
such uses to the receipts from the National Forests,
for it is in effect income which instead of being
put into the treasury is made available for the
benefit of the people.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be seen that a
large part of the benefits derived from the systematic
administration of the National Forests cannot
be measured in dollars and cents. These benefits
are in effect privileges extended to the people who
in return assist in the protection of the Forests from
fire and thus more than repay the Government for
what they receive. Even under the rather unfavorable
revenue producing conditions mentioned
above, it is interesting to note that in 1917 the receipts
of thirty-two National Forests exceeded their
total expenditures. On fifteen others the receipts
exceeded the cost of protection and administration.
In other words, one-third of the National Forests
are practically self-supporting.</p>

<p><i>The New Eastern National Forests.</i> The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
success with which the National Forest policy was
launched in the Western States was largely responsible
for the inauguration of a similar policy
in the Appalachian and White Mountains. The
main purpose for which these forests are to be acquired
is to preserve a steady stream flow for water-power
navigation and domestic use, and to lessen
the damage caused by floods and erosion. These
forests are of vital influence in controlling the flow
of the Merrimac, Connecticut, Androscoggin, Potomac,
James, Santee, Savannah, Tennessee, and
Monongahela rivers. Some years ago the Merrimac
drove mills worth over $100,000,000, which
employed over 80,000 people. Upon these, it is
said, 350,000 were dependent for support. In the
Carolinas and Georgia alone the cotton mills operated
by water-power turn out an annual product
valued at almost $100,000,000. In these mills
60,000 people are employed, upon whom 250,000
are dependent for support. These mills utilize
106,000 horsepower. The forests which control
these waters are therefore of great pecuniary value.</p>

<p>The Act of March 1, 1911, commonly known as
the Weeks Law, made the acquisition of forest
lands in the Appalachian and White Mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
possible. Up to June 30, 1917, over 1,500,000
acres have been approved for purchase by the National
Forest Reservation Commission. The Forest
Service has been designated as the bureau to
examine and value such lands as may be offered
for purchase. The original appropriation was
$2,000,000 per year for five and one-half years, beginning
the last half of the fiscal year 1911. The
Agricultural Appropriation Bill for the fiscal year
1913 made the appropriation for 1912 and subsequent
years available until expended. A further
appropriation of $3,000,000 was provided later for
the same purpose, to be expended during the fiscal
years 1917 and 1918. Under Section 2 of the same
law coöperative fire protection with the States was
provided for. This section of the law provided that
the Forest Service should maintain a coöperative
system of forest fire protection with those States
which have a law providing for a system of fire
protection for state and private forest lands upon
the watersheds of navigable streams. In no case
was the amount to be expended by the Forest
Service to exceed the amount appropriated by the
State for the same purpose in any given fiscal year.
The original appropriation was $200,000 and subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
appropriations have been for $100,000 annually.
Twenty-one States are coöperating with
the Forest Service in this way.</p>

<p>By the passage of the Weeks Bill, Congress has
voiced the sentiment that the forest fire problem,
<i>even on private land</i>, is not only no longer a private
problem, is not even exclusively a state problem,
but a joint problem and duty to be borne by the
State and nation. Forest fires are now rightfully
looked upon as a public enemy rather than a private
menace. This is a big step in the right direction,
and it is hoped that this same principle
will be applied in the not too distant future to all
other matters dealing with private timber lands.
If the protection of these private timber lands is a
public and not a private problem, then certainly
their management for continuity is a public problem.
A timber owner should not be allowed to cut
his timber without the consent of the Government,
and the Government should see to it that he leaves
the young growth as a basis for a future crop or
provides a new growth of timber by planting young
trees.</p>

<h3>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO FOREST CONSERVATION</h3>

<p>In order that the reader may fully appreciate the
gigantic task that has been accomplished in bringing
the National Forest administration and organization
to its present state of development, it is
necessary to briefly sketch the conditions that led
up to the inauguration of the Federal Forest Policy
before we stop to consider that policy and the
establishment and organization of National Forests.</p>

<p><i>Prodigality Leads Finally to Conservation.</i>
Every great movement, which has for its object the
betterment of the lot of mankind, lags far behind
the times. There must be an actual economic need
before a new movement can be expected to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
root and flourish. Forest conservation had no
place in the household economy of nations that had
forests in superabundance. Their forests were
used with prodigality. It seems to be a great
human failing to use natural resources lavishly
when the supply is apparently unlimited, and to
practice frugality only when the end of a resource
is in sight. Thus we find in the pages of forestry
history that all nations have begun to husband their
forest resources only after having felt the pinch of
want. In our country history repeats itself and
our federal policy of forest conservation properly
begins at the time that the national conscience was
awakened to the realization that if we did not practice
economy with our forest resources we would
some day be without an adequate supply of timber
and forage, and be confronted with other dangers
and calamities that follow the destruction of forests.</p>

<p><i>The March of Forest Destruction.</i> When the
London Company settled at Jamestown, Virginia,
in 1607 it found that unlimited pine and hardwood
forests confronted it on every side. Nor did
these early settlers ever find a way out of this forested
wilderness except by clearings made with the
ax. When the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Cod in 1620 they found similar forests stretching
in all directions from their town-site. After the
Atlantic seaboard became pretty well settled the
home-builders began moving westward through
New York, Pennsylvania, and what is now Ohio.
Still nothing but unbroken, virgin forests were encountered.
Westward to the Mississippi civilization
advanced and still forests reigned supreme.
Then the Middle West, the Rocky Mountain region,
and finally the Pacific Coast regions were settled.
During 140 years civilization has spread from
coast to coast and of that vast wilderness of forest
there is left only a remnant here and there. The
giant pines that sheltered De Soto and his thousand
followers on their ill-fated expedition in 1541 to the
Mississippi River have long since disappeared.
Along the Allegheny and Appalachian ranges the
vast forests that once harbored the hostile Narragansetts
and Iroquois are now but a memory. The
giant oak, ash, and cypress forests of the Mississippi
Valley are rapidly being decimated by the big
sawmills that work night and day to outdo each
other. In the north the dense and magnificent forests
of white pine that greeted Father Marquette,
when he planted his missionary station at Sault Ste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Marie in 1668, have been laid low. Unproductive
wastes, sandy barrens, and useless underbrush now
greet the eye. In fact the pine forests which covered
the greater part of Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota have been leveled by the woodman's ax.
The army of lumbermen has moved now to the
Coast to again turn virgin timberlands into unproductive
wastes.</p>

<p>Thus forest destruction has followed civilization.
Statistics show very vividly how gradually one
large lumbering center after another has become
exhausted, often leaving behind desolation and business
depression. In these large centers thriving
towns sprang up only to disappear again after the
removal of the forest wealth. In 1850 about 55
per cent, of the annual cut of lumber came from
the New England States; even as late as 1865 New
York furnished more lumber than any State in the
Union. By 1890 Michigan had reached the zenith
of its production and in that year the Lake States
furnished 36 per cent. of the lumber cut. By 1909
the Southern States had increased their cut to over
50 per cent. of the total of the country. In 1913
the cut of the State of Washington was the largest
ever recorded for that State or for any other State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
even outdoing Michigan during its Golden Age.
In 1915 about 20 per cent. of the cut came from
the Coast but the South still furnished almost 50
per cent.</p>

<p><i>Our Lumber and Water Supply Imperiled.</i> In
our prodigal use of our forest resources we have
become the most lavish users of wood in the world.
While the annual consumption per capita for
France is about 25 cubic feet, and that of Germany
about 40 cubic feet, our per capita consumption is
in the neighborhood of 250 cubic feet. And the
most terrible thing about our reckless methods has
been that we have wasted by crude lumbering methods
and we have let great forest fires consume many
times as much lumber as we have used. There have
been vast public and private losses through unnecessary
forest fires which not only consumed millions
of dollars' worth of timber every year, but
which also cost the lives of thousands of settlers.
Then, as every one knows, by being grossly negligent
with our forests, our rivers have visited their
wrath upon the unfortunate people in the valleys.
Many streams have become raging torrents in the
spring and only chains of stagnant pools in the
summer, thus destroying their value for water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
power and irrigation. Cotton mills, which formerly
used water power all the year round, now
must depend upon more expensive steam power
generated by coal to keep their mills running in
times of water shortage, while during high water
there is the great danger that the entire factory
might be swept away.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST STEPS IN FEDERAL FOREST CONSERVATION.</h3>

<p>Gradually the national conscience became awakened
to the need of a more rational use of our forest
resources. But it was not until after the Civil
War that the first steps were taken. As was to
be expected, the States in which forest destruction
had reached its worst stages were the first to attempt
to mend their ways, thus leading the way
along which the Federal Government was soon to
follow.</p>

<p><i>The Upbuilding of the West.</i> The decade following
the Civil War is marked by the construction
of some of our great trans-continental railroads
and the consequent development of the great
western country. In fact between 1865 and 1875
the railroad mileage of the United States doubled.
The first trans-continental railroad, the Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Pacific, was completed in 1869. Others soon followed.
To encourage construction and settlement
vast tracts of land were granted to the railroad
companies by the Government, and with the land
much valuable timber passed from government
ownership. After the construction of the railroads
towns and villages sprang up like mushrooms. As
was to be expected with this increased development
the destruction of our forests received an added
impetus. The Lake States, then the center of
the lumber industry, began to take alarm at the
rapidity with which their hillsides were being denuded.
Destructive lumbering, usually followed
by devastating forest fires, was fast decimating the
virgin pine forests. The young growth that had
escaped the lumberman's ax fell a prey to forest
fires which soon took the form of annual conflagrations.
As the population increased the new sections
of the country were settled, and as manufacturing
operations were extended timber was getting
higher in price.</p>

<p><i>The Lake States First to Act.</i> The first attempt
to remedy the situation was made by the
State of Wisconsin. In 1867 the Wisconsin legislature
suggested a committee who should report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
upon the destruction of Wisconsin's forests. The
next year Michigan took a similar step and in 1869
the Maine legislature began to look into their waning
supply by appointing a committee to estimate
the standing timber of the State. As early as this
observations and calculations upon the rate of consumption
of lumber pointed to a not far distant
wood famine.</p>

<p><i>The First Federal Steps.</i> The first step taken
by the federal authorities was at the urgent request
of the Statistician of the Department of Agriculture
in 1870. At that time lands were recognized
as being either "improved" or "unimproved" farm
lands. He recommended that the category of "unimproved
farm lands" be subdivided into "woodlands"
and "other unimproved lands." By thus
dividing off woodlands from other unimproved
farm lands more attention was concentrated upon
the former. This attention was manifested in the
investigations that followed shortly in which it was
estimated that 39 per cent. of the area of the country
was in woodland. This was the first and most
logical step toward taking an inventory of our forest
resources.</p>

<p>Another early attempt to assist in forest conservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was an attempt to reforest the treeless plains
of our Western States. On March 3, 1873, the
Timber Culture Act was passed by Congress by
which the planting to timber of 40 acres of land
in the treeless territories conferred the title to 160
acres of public domain. At first this act seemed
to work out as intended but it did not take very
many years before it proved a dismal failure. Settlers
had no knowledge of planting trees; the restrictions
of the act could not be enforced, and the
act was open to other abuses. The act was finally
repealed in 1891. Many similar laws for encouraging
the planting of timber were passed by the
legislatures of some of the Middle Western States,
but all met with little success. In 1874 Nebraska
inaugurated Arbor Day. By this act of the legislature
the second Wednesday in April of each year
was set aside for planting trees. Other States have
followed the example of Nebraska, so that to-day
almost every State provides one day in the year
for planting trees. Thus Arbor Day has become
practically a national institution.</p>

<p><i>The Act of August 16, 1876.</i> The first constructive
piece of legislation enacted by the Congress
of the United States was the Act of August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
16, 1876. This was the first of a series of Acts
passed by Congress which, although occurring
many years apart in some cases, put forest conservation
upon a firm basis. Under the first act the
Commissioner of Agriculture was directed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To appoint some man of approved attainments who is
practically well acquainted with methods of statistical inquiry
and who has evinced an intimate acquaintance with questions
relating to the national wants in regard to timber, to
prosecute investigations and inquiries with the view of ascertaining
the annual amount of consumption, importation, and exportation
of timber and other forest products; the probable
supply for future wants; the means best adapted to their
preservation and renewal; the influence of forests upon
climate and the means that have been successfully applied in
foreign countries, or that may be deemed applicable in this
country for the preservation and restoration or planting of
forests, and to report upon the same to the Commissioner of
Agriculture, to be by him in a separate report transmitted to
Congress."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Franklin B. Hough, an active, untiring, and
intelligent scholar, was the first man to be appointed
by this act. As Commissioner of Forestry
he prepared the first report and submitted it to Congress.
The next year, in 1877, Congress granted
its first appropriation of $6,000, "for the purpose of
obtaining other facts and information preparatory
to establishing a Division of Forestry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<i>Further Work Under the Act.</i> The office of
Commissioner of Forestry gradually enlarged the
scope of its duties and functions. Five years later,
due to the ever-increasing importance of the subject,
a distinct division, the Division of Forestry,
was established in the Department of Agriculture.
The duties and powers of this Division were "to devote
itself exclusively to such investigations of the
subject as would tend to the fullest development
of the resources of the country in that respect, to
discover the best methods of managing and preserving
our waning forests and to maintain in all its
bearings the universal interest involved in that industry."</p>

<p>In 1881 an agent of the Department was
sent to Europe to study the work of forestry
there. In 1882 the American Forestry Congress
was organized. This organization had for its object
the discussion and dissemination of the important
facts of forestry, and while strictly a private
body, had a considerable influence in later years in
educating the people to the needs of forestry and
in helping to establish a rational forest policy in
the United States. Its first meeting took place in
Cincinnati. At a second meeting held the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
year in Montreal the name was changed to the
American Forestry Association and since then has
been the center of all private efforts to advance
the forestry movement. In 1898 this association
began the publication of a propagandist journal
which is now called <i>American Forestry</i>. In
1884 the duty of making experiments with timber
was added to the functions of the Division. The
next year the collecting and distribution of valuable
economic tree seeds was begun. In 1886 the study
of the biology of some of our important timber
trees was taken up, while in the following year
silvicultural problems first engaged the attention
of the Division.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST FOREST RESERVES ESTABLISHED MARCH 30, 1891</h3>

<p><i>The Situation Before 1891.</i> Before 1891 the
Division of Forestry was simply a bureau of information.
In general the information supplied
was of a twofold nature. It was technical in so
far as it related to the management of private
woodlands and statistical in so far as the knowledge
of the conditions of our forest resources induced
the application of forestry principles. Up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to that date Congress had neither appropriated
enough money for efficient outdoor work nor did
she attempt to put any government woodlands under
the control of the Division. Therefore there
had been no management because there were no
forests to manage. This one-sided development
of the forestry work of the Division was greatly
impeding a rational development of the forest conservation
movement.</p>

<p><i>The Need of a Forest Policy.</i> The need for a
well-defined forest policy with respect to the government
forest lands now began to be felt. Railroad
land grants, the Homestead Act, Preëmption
claims, and the Timber and Stone Act were taking
much valuable timberland out of government ownership.
People secured claims under these acts
merely for the timber that was on them. The purposes
of the laws and acts of Congress were being
fraudulently evaded. Also the Government had
restrictive and protective laws in regard to its lands,
but it could not enforce them on account of lack
of appropriations with which to maintain an administrative
and protective organization. The time
was now ripe for an executive policy to manage
the woodlands that still remained in the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the Government before it was too late to save
what was left.</p>

<p><i>The Act of March 3, 1891.</i> The Division of Forestry
was designed by the nature of its duties to
be more than a bureau of information. The existence
of a governmental department to promulgate
forestry principles while the Government itself had
made no provision to apply such principles to its
own permanent timberlands was an incongruity
that suggested further legislative action. This
was in part supplied by the law of March 3,
1891, which conferred upon the President the power
to establish Forest Reservations. The first exercise
of power under this act was the presidential proclamation
creating the Yellowstone Park Timber
Land Reserve under President Harrison on March
30, 1891. This was probably the wisest step yet
taken in the development of a National Forest
policy; but, unfortunately, the act left the Division
simply a bureau of information as it was before.</p>

<h3>AN ANOMALOUS CONDITION&mdash;FOREST RESERVES WITHOUT FOREST ADMINISTRATION</h3>

<p><i>The Need of Administration on the Reserves.</i>
At first thought it will be seen that this piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
legislation must necessarily remain inoperative unless
it were followed by the establishment of a
proper administration of the Reserves based upon
sound forestry principles. Furthermore, the law
withdrew from public use all such lands that
might be acquired under it. It was now easy for
the Government to acquire lands; the question that
next presented itself was how to protect and regulate
the use of these new acquisitions. Forest protection
cannot be secured without forest rangers
and forest guards; nor forest management without
technical foresters. The very reasons for establishing
the Reserves would point to the absolute
need of a system of managing them. These reasons
were briefly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"to prevent annual conflagrations; to prevent useless destruction
of life and property by fires, etc.; to provide benefit
and revenue from the sale of forest products, fuels, and
timbers; to administer this resource for future benefit; to increase
the stock of game; to promote the development of the
country; to give regular employment to a professional staff;
to secure continuous supplies of wood and to get the maximum
amount of good from each acre."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Such arguments as these assume the presence of a
force of men to protect and administrate these
Reserves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>More Reserves Created.</i> In spite of this serious
fault in the Act of March 3, 1891, more Forest
Reservations were created. By 1894 Presidents
Harrison and Cleveland had created about 17,500,000
acres and on a single day, February 22, 1897,
President Cleveland proclaimed over 20,000,000
acres. By the close of 1897 a total of almost 40,000,000
acres of Forest Reserves had been established.</p>

<p>During the six years following the law giving the
President power to establish Reserves, the Reserves
were under the jurisdiction of the General Land
Office. The appropriations of Congress were
small, amounting to less than $30,000 annually.
Such appropriations were used mainly for testing
timber strength and the conditions affecting quality.</p>

<h3>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RESERVES UNDER THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE</h3>

<p><i>The Act of June 4, 1897.</i> The Secretary of the
Interior in 1896 requested the National Academy
of Sciences, the legally constituted advisor of the
Government in scientific matters, to investigate, report
upon, and recommend a National Forest policy.
This resulted in the Act of June 4, 1897,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
under which, with subsequent amendments, the National
Forests are now being administered. Under
this act the Reserves remained in the hands of the
General Land Office, Department of the Interior.
It charged this office with the administration and
protection of the Forest Reservations. Later the
Geological Survey was charged with surveying and
mapping them, and the Division of Forestry was
asked to give technical advice. It is very evident
that the Division of Forestry containing all the
trained scientific staff had no relation to the government
forestry work except as the offices of the Department
of the Interior might apply for assistance
or advice. It is true that an important step had
been taken, but the complete separation of the administration
by the General Land Office and the
force of trained men in the Division of Forestry was
a serious defect.</p>

<p>The Act of June 4 might be called the Magna
Charta of national forestry. The <span class="locked">U. S.</span> Geological
Survey undertook the task of surveying, classifying,
and describing the Forest Reservations. At a
cost of about one and one-half million dollars over
70,000,000 acres of Forest Reserves were mapped
and described. The General Land Office undertook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the administration and Forest Superintendents and
Rangers were appointed to take charge of the
Reservations. The rules and regulations for administering
the Reserves were formulated by the
Commissioner of the General Land Office.</p>

<p><i>The Division of Forestry in 1898.</i> On July 1,
1898, the Division of Forestry employed 11 persons,
6 clerical and 5 scientific. There were also
some collaborators and student assistants. There
was no field equipment and no field work. But in
the fall of 1898 an important step was taken.
From that time on the Division of Forestry offered
practical assistance to forest owners and thus it
shifted its field of activity from the desk to the
woods. The lumbermen were met on their own
grounds and actual forest management for purely
commercial ends was undertaken by well known
lumbermen. From that time dates the solution of
specific problems of forest management and the
development of efficient methods of attacking them.
The work of the Division at this time, therefore,
consisted of activities along 4 distinct lines: (1)
that of working plans, (2) that of economic tree
planting, (3) that of special investigations, and (4)
that of office work. Thus it will be seen, even at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this late date the Division had practically nothing to
say about the scientific forestry methods which
should be used on the Reservations.</p>

<p><i>The Bureau of Forestry.</i> In 1901 the Division
of Forestry was raised to the rank of a Bureau, but
this was a change in name only and carried with
it no change in the handling of the Government's
vast forest resources.</p>

<h3>THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE FORESTRY WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN 1905</h3>

<p><i>The Act of February 1, 1905.</i> The necessity of
consolidating the various branches of government
forest work became apparent and was urged upon
Congress by President Roosevelt and by the executive
officers concerned. This was finally accomplished
by the act of February 1, 1905, by which
entire jurisdiction over the Forest Reserves was
transferred to the Secretary of Agriculture. Matters
of surveying and passage of title, however,
were still kept under the jurisdiction of the General
Land Office. By this act the Division of Forestry
for the first time in its career became an administrative
organization. On July 1 of the same
year the Bureau of Forestry became the Forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Service and in 1907 the change of name from "Forest
Reserves" to "National Forests" was made to
correct the impression that the forests were like
reserves which had been withdrawn from use.</p>

<p><i>Early Forestry Education and Literature.</i> The
Act of February 1, 1905, was the final step which
established the federal policy with regard to our
National Forests. At this stage it will be interesting
to note briefly the status of the science of American
Forestry and of forestry education. As late
as the spring of 1898 there was no science or literature
on American Forestry, nor could education
in the subject be procured in the country. But
soon thereafter several forestry schools were established,
namely, Cornell Forestry School in 1898,
Yale School of Forestry and Biltmore Forest
School in 1899, and the University of Michigan
Forestry School in 1903. The beginning of the
twentieth century saw the first professional foresters
graduated and taking upon themselves the task
of applying scientific forestry methods to the National
Forests. Further evidence of the growth of
the profession of forestry was the organization of
the Society of American Foresters in 1900. The
first professional journal was started in 1902 as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<i>Forestry Quarterly</i>, and other scientific forestry
literature was issued by the Government. The
scientific knowledge gathered in the field work
since 1898 has taken the form of a rapidly growing
literature on the subject which has formed the basis
of the science of American Forestry.</p>

<p><i>Changes in the Forest Service Personnel.</i> By
1905 the work of the Forest Service had increased
to such an extent that the number of employees
was increased to 821. With the opening of the forestry
schools, professional foresters became available
and the National Forests then began to be put
into the hands of expert scientific men. Gradually
the old type of untrained, non-scientific woodsman
is being replaced by the trained forester. In addition,
the entire force was made a part of the classified
Civil Service and the plan of political appointees
was banished forever.</p>

<p><i>More National Forests Created.</i> While the administration
of the National Forests was being adjusted
the area of National Forests was constantly
being increased. To the 40,000,000 acres of Reserves
set aside by Presidents Harrison and Cleveland
before 1897, President McKinley added over
7,000,000 acres until 1901. When Roosevelt became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
President the National Forest policy received
an added impetus and vigor. Being a great lover
of the out-of-door-life and being especially well acquainted,
on account of his extensive travels, with
the great western country, President Roosevelt
threw his powerful influence into the balance.
With the close coöperation of Mr. Gifford Pinchot,
his warm personal friend, and at that time the Chief
Forester, Mr. Roosevelt set aside between 1901 and
1909 over 148,000,000 acres of National Forests,
more than three times as much as had been set aside
by all his predecessors together. Since 1909 a careful
adjustment of the boundaries has been going on,
both Presidents Taft and Wilson adding small
areas here and there, which were found valuable
for forestry purposes, or eliminating small areas
found to have no value. Acts of Congress passed
since 1907 prohibit the addition by the President
to the National Forests already established in
Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, and Colorado. Additions can be made
in these States only by special act of Congress. A
number of such acts have been passed; some of them
upon petitions of the people in these States.</p>

<p><i>The Growth of the Forest Service.</i> The growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the Forest Service between 1897 and 1917 is
little short of marvelous. The number of its employees
has increased from 61 in 1898 to 3,544 on
June 30, 1917. The annual appropriations have
increased from less than $30,000 in 1897 to $5,712,275
for the fiscal year 1918. But besides this appropriation
for 1918 the Weeks Law calls for an
expenditure of $2,100,000 and the Federal Aid
Road Act for $1,000,000 more. The receipts of
the National Forests have also increased by leaps
and bounds. In 1897 the receipts were practically
negligible in amount but by 1906 they had reached
approximately $800,000. In the fiscal year 1917
they were more than $3,457,000.</p>

<p><i>Recent Modifications in the Organization.</i> Further
slight modifications in the organization, as established
in 1905, were made since that date. Before
1908 all the work of the Forests was supervised
from the main office in Washington and this arrangement
caused much delay and inconvenience
in carrying on the business of the Forests. In the
fall of 1908 six administrative districts were established,
to which another was added in 1914. By
this arrangement the National Forests are divided
into 7 groups and each group has a district headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in a large city or town centrally located
in the group. The District Office acts as sort of
clearing house for all National Forest business.
All matters in the administration and protection of
the National Forests that cannot be settled on the
Forest or appear to be of general importance to
the district are taken to the District Office, which
is in charge of a District Forester and several assistants.
Beginning in 1909 Forest Experiment
Stations were established in each district and in
1910 the Forest Products Laboratory, the first one
of its kind in the world, was formally opened at
Madison, Wisconsin. The Weeks Law, passed on
March 1, 1911, provides for the acquisition of forest
lands on the watersheds of navigable streams in
the Appalachian and White Mountains. Up to
June 30, 1917, over 1,500,000 acres have been approved

<h3>THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF THE FOREST SERVICE</h3>

<p><i>The Administrative Districts.</i> The administration
of the National Forests and the conduct of all
matters relating to forestry which have been placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
upon the Department of Agriculture are in charge
of the Forester whose office is in Washington, <span class="locked">D. C.</span>
To facilitate the administration of the Forests 7
districts have been established with headquarters in
the following places:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang5">District.&nbsp;1.&nbsp;(Montana, northeastern Washington, northern
Idaho, and northwestern South Dakota) Missoula,
Montana.</p>

<p class="hang5">District.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;(Colorado, Wyoming, the remainder of South
Dakota, Nebraska, northern Michigan, and
northern Minnesota) Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p class="hang5">District.&nbsp;3.&nbsp;(Most of Arizona and New Mexico) Albuquerque,
New Mexico.</p>

<p class="hang5">District.&nbsp;4.&nbsp;(Utah, southern Idaho, western Wyoming, eastern
and central Nevada, and northwestern Arizona)
Ogden, Utah.</p>

<p class="hang5">District.&nbsp;5.&nbsp;(California and western Nevada) San Francisco,
California.</p>

<p class="hang5">District.&nbsp;6.&nbsp;(Washington, Oregon, and Alaska) Portland,
Oregon.</p>

<p class="hang5">District.&nbsp;7.&nbsp;(Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and the newly purchased
areas in South Carolina, Georgia, North
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia,
New Hampshire, Maine, and Alabama,) Washington,
<span class="locked">D. C.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Each administrative district embraces a number of
National Forests and is in charge of a Forest officer
known as the District Forester who is responsible to
the Forester for all administrative and technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
work performed within the district. Each District
Forester is aided by several assistants and by specialists
in various lines of work. Each National
Forest is in charge of a Forest Supervisor who may
have a Deputy and a Forest Assistant or Forest
Examiner to assist him if the amount of business on
a National Forest warrants it. Each National
Forest is subdivided into Ranger districts for the
purpose of facilitating the protection work. Each
Ranger district is in charge of a Ranger who may
be assisted by other Rangers or Forest Guards.</p>

<p><i>The Washington Office.</i> The work of the Forest
Service in Washington is organized under the
Office of Forester and the Branches of Operation,
Lands, Silviculture, Research, Grazing, Engineering,
and Acquisition of lands under the Weeks Law.
The Office of Forester includes the Associate Forester,
the Editor, the Dendrologist, the Chief of
Accounts, besides Inspectors and Lumbermen.
The Branch of Operation administers and supervises
the business organization of the Forest Service
and has general supervision of the personnel, quarters,
equipment, and supplies of the Service and all
the fire protection and permanent improvement
work on the National Forests. The Branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Lands examines and classifies lands in the Forests
to determine their value for forest purposes, conducts
the work in connection with claims on the Forests
prior to proceedings before United States registers
and receivers, and assists the Chief Engineer
of the Service in handling matters in connection
with the occupation and use of the National Forest
lands for hydro-electric power purposes. The
Branch of Silviculture supervises the sale and cutting
of timber on the National Forests and coöperates
with States in protecting forest lands under
Section 2 of the Weeks Law. The Branch of Research
has supervision over the investigative work
of the Service, including silvicultural studies,
studies of state forest conditions, investigations of
the lumber and wood-using industries and lumber
prices, and the investigative work carried on at the
Forest Products Laboratory and the Forest Experiment
Stations. The Branch of Grazing supervises
the grazing of live stock upon the National
Forests, allotting grazing privileges and dividing
the ranges between different owners and classes of
stock. It is also charged with the work of improving
depleted grazing lands and of coöperating with
the Federal and state authorities in the enforcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of stock quarantine regulations. The Branch
of Engineering has to do with the proper designing
and planning of roads, trails, and bridges; with the
engineering problems involved in granting permits
to hydro-electric plants in the Forests; and with the
making of forest maps, surveys, improving the forest
atlas, and other drafting work. The Branch of
Acquisition of Lands under the Weeks Law has
charge of examining and evaluating such lands
which are offered for purchase and recommending
suitable lands for purchase under the act.</p>

<p><i>The District Offices.</i> Each District Office (of
which there are 7) is organized in the main along
the same lines as the Washington office. Each
Branch in the Washington office is represented in
the District Office by an Assistant District Forester
or some similar official. The Office of the District
Forester has in addition the Office of Solicitor
(Forest Service Branch), which is in charge of an
assistant to the Solicitor of the Department of
Agriculture. He is the advisor to the District Forester
in all matters of law which arise in the administration
of the National Forests. His opinions
are usually binding except that, in urgent cases,
appeal may be taken to the Solicitor of the Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
at Washington through the Forester. Many
cases of law arise on the National Forests such as
cases of timber, fire, and grazing trespass. All
these are handled in the Office of the District Forester.
The Office of Accounts in the districts is
in charge of the District Fiscal Agent who is an
assistant to the Chief of Accounts in the Washington
Office. Three of the districts have a Branch
of Products. The Experiment Stations in the districts
are under the supervision of the District Forester
and the men in charge of them bear the same
relation to the District Office as the Supervisor of a
National Forest. Most of the districts also have
in the Office of Silviculture a Consulting Pathologist
who has charge of all problems relating to tree
diseases.</p>

<p>The following scheme will illustrate in a general
way the organization of the Forest Service and
show how the National Forests are administered at
the present time:</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br /><br />

<span class="subhead">THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL FORESTS</span></h2>

<p>Under the head of administration we must necessarily
understand those factors which are essential
to carry on the business of the National Forests.
First of all we must consider the personnel, that is,
the men that make up the organization by means of
which the work on the Forests is done. Next we
must learn how the money for this large enterprise
is appropriated each year to carry on the work,
and how it is divided up so that each National Forest
gets an amount each year in proportion to its
needs. Then again men and money are of little
avail without tools, equipment, and supplies. The
proper distribution of these to the 147 National
Forests is no small business organization in itself.
Lastly we must learn of the many permanent improvements
which are made on the National Forests
which are absolutely necessary for their proper
administration, protection and use. No large constructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
forestry enterprise is complete without
these. They consist of the construction of means
of transportation, means of communication, and
living quarters for the personnel; of extensive
planting of young trees to reëstablish forests which
have been destroyed by fires; the carrying on of research
and experiments to aid in the development
of the best methods of forestry; and the classification
and segregation of agricultural lands and the
establishment of permanent boundaries. All these
matters must necessarily be considered before we
attempt to learn about the protection and the utilization
of the National Forests.</p>

<h3>PERSONNEL</h3>

<p><i>Duties of Forest Officers.</i> Forest officers are the
servants of the people and they are expected to
assist in every way possible those who wish to use
the resources of the Forests. Their first duty is to
enforce the regulations under which all permits,
leases, sales, and rentals are made. These regulations
cover every phase of National Forest activity
and in conducting business under them they must
not let personal or other interests weigh against the
good of the Forests. For the good of the Forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Service their conduct must be prompt and courteous
and their business methods sensible and effective.
They make it their business to prevent misunderstandings
and violations of forest regulations
rather than to correct mistakes after they have been
made.</p>

<p>On the National Forests there are permanent
employees and temporary employees. Under the
former heading come the Forest Supervisor, the
Deputy Supervisor, the Forest Assistant, the Forest
Ranger, Lumbermen, Sealers, Planting Assistants,
and Forest Clerks. Under the latter category
come the Forest Guards, the Field Assistants,
and the Temporary Laborers. All permanent
positions are in the classified Civil Service. Vacancies
are filled from a certified list of those who
have passed a Civil Service examination or by promotion
from the lower ranks.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>The Forest Supervisor.</i> A Forest Supervisor is
in charge of each National Forest and he plans the
work of the Forest and supervises its execution.
He works, of course, under direct instruction from
the District Forester and is responsible to him.
When the amount of business on the Forest warrants
it he is assisted by a Deputy Supervisor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Both these positions are filled by the promotion of
experienced men in the classified Civil Service.
The Forest Supervisor's headquarters are located
in towns conveniently situated with regard to the
most important points in his Forest. The town is
usually located on a railroad and centrally located
with regard to the various Ranger districts of his
Forest. His headquarters are usually the center
of the system of roads and trails which covers his
entire Forest. From his office also the telephone
system radiates in all directions to his various
District Rangers. In short, the Forest Supervisor's
office is so situated that he has at all times full
knowledge of all the activities of his Forest; he is
therefore in a position to give advice and directions
by telephone to his Rangers and other subordinates
almost at any time of the day or night. Such intimate
communication is of especial importance during
the fire season.</p>

<p>Some Forests have two headquarters, one that
is occupied in the winter and the other that is occupied
in the summer. The summer quarters is usually
most advantageously situated as far as the business
of the Forest is concerned, but owing to deep
snow, which seriously interferes with mail and telephone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
connections, a more accessible winter quarters
is occupied from October to May.</p>

<p>The force of men the Forest Supervisor has
working under him varies of course with the amount
of work to be performed. The permanent force is
usually from 10 to 15 men, which during the fire
season may be increased to from 25 to 40 and in
cases of great fire emergency sometimes to several
hundred men, by the addition of temporary employees.</p>

<p><i>The Forest Assistant.</i> The other permanent
men on a National Forest are the Forest Assistant
or Forest Examiner, Forest Rangers, and a Forest
clerk with his assistant, the Stenographer and Typewriter.
The Forest Assistant or Examiner ranks
next to the Deputy and his work is directed by the
Forest Supervisor, to whom he makes his reports.
The Forest Assistant is the technical man of the
Forest force, who upon making good is promoted to
Forest Examiner. He is employed upon such technical
lines of work as the examination and mapping
of forest areas; reports on applications for the purchase
of timber; marking, scaling, and managing
timber sales; the survey of boundaries; and nursery
and planting work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Not only is a Forest Assistant called upon to
perform these various lines of technical work. The
very nature of the country he is in indicates that he
must be an all-round practical man. He must be
able to ride, pack, and drive. He must often live
alone and therefore must do his own cooking, washing,
and take care of other personal needs. He
must be strong and healthy and capable of undergoing
hardships, at least be able to stand long days
of walking, climbing, and horseback riding. His
various duties and the different situations that arise
often call for knowledge and practical ability as a
carpenter, a mechanic, a plumber, an engineer, a
surveyor, and many other lines of work. Perhaps
more important than his education and ability are
his personal qualifications. His temperament must
be such that he must feel satisfied and contented
under the most trying conditions. He must be able
to do without most of the comforts of modern civilization
for most of the time. For these reasons
the country-bred western youths are more liable to
make a success of the work than the city-bred easterner.</p>

<p><i>The Forest Ranger.</i> The Forest Ranger's position
is one of the most important and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
time the most difficult positions on our National
Forests.</p>

<p>The Forest Ranger's headquarters are usually at
the nearest business center to his district and if that
is not practicable permanent headquarters are provided
on the Forest. In any case his station is located
as near to the center of the business activity
of his district as possible. If his headquarters
are centrally located in his district, trails, roads, and
telephone lines lead out from his cabin to all parts
of his district. His station is built and maintained
at government expense and usually has, besides
his living quarters, a barn, tool-house, pasture, corral,
and other necessary improvements.</p>

<p>The Forest Ranger performs such routine work
as the supervision of timber sales, grazing, free use,
special use, and other contracts and permits, the
carrying out of the protection and improvement
plans for his district, and other administrative
duties. The average Forest Ranger has a territory
of from 75,000 to 150,000 acres to take care
of. On June 30, 1917, there were about 1,100
Forest Rangers employed on the National Forests
who were assisted by over 900 Assistant Forest
Rangers and Forest Guards. The protective force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was therefore about one man for every 77,800 acres
or about 121 square miles.</p>

<p>The Forest Ranger must be a man who is physically
sound and capable of enduring great hardships.
He is often required to do heavy manual
labor in fighting fire under the most trying conditions.
For this reason he must have great endurance.
They are usually men who have been
brought up in timber work, on ranches or farms, or
with the stock business. They are therefore thoroughly
familiar with the region in which they are
to be employed and especially acquainted with the
rough, semi-primitive life which is characteristic of
remote places in the West.</p>

<p>He must be able to take care of himself and his
horses in regions remote from settlement and supplies.
He must be able to build trails, roads and
cabins; he must be able to ride, pack, and drive and
deal tactfully with all classes of people. He must
know something about land surveying, estimating,
and scaling timber; of logging, mining laws, and the
live stock business. His duties include patrol to
prevent fire and trespass; estimating, surveying,
and marking timber; the supervision of cutting and
similar work. He is authorized to issue permits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
build cabins and trails, oversee grazing business,
investigate mining and agricultural claims, report
upon applications, and report upon and arrest for
the violation of Forest laws and regulations.</p>

<p><i>The Forest Clerk.</i> The Forest Clerk performs
the clerical work and the book-keeping in the Forest
Supervisor's office. He sometimes has a Stenographer
and Typewriter to assist him and to do the
mechanical work of correspondence. Lumbermen
are specialists who are thoroughly well versed in all
that pertains to logging, milling, scaling, and cruising
timber. They are assigned temporarily to Forests
where need for their work arises. Scalers are
men thoroughly familiar with the art of scaling or
measuring logs, ties, poles, cord wood and other forest
products. Planting Assistants are specialists
in nursery and planting work. Their duties include
the preparation of seed beds, seed sowing,
transplanting and care of seedlings, and field planting.
They are assigned to the Forest Service nurseries.</p>

<p>Temporary Laborers, Forest Guards, and Field
Assistants are employed during the field season
when additional work on the National Forests warrants
it. Forest Guards perform temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
protection, administrative, and improvement work;
Field Assistants, usually students of forestry serving
their apprenticeships, are usually employed at
minor technical work and timber cruising; Temporary
Laborers are employed by the day or month at
any kind of improvement or maintenance work.</p>

<p><i>Forest Service Meetings.</i> A general meeting of
the Forest force is usually held annually to give the
Forest officers the benefit of each other's experience,
to keep in touch with the entire work of the Forest,
and to promote "esprit-de-corps." The time and
place of the meeting depends upon circumstances,
but it is usually held at a time of the year when
there is least danger from fire. Often joint meetings
are held with the forces of adjacent Forests.
This annual meeting idea is carried through the entire
Forest Service. The Forest Supervisors in
each administrative district usually meet at the
district headquarters once a year and the District
Foresters of all the districts together with representative
officers from the Washington office usually
meet annually at some centrally located district
office such as the one at Ogden, Utah. These
meetings assist greatly in keeping all the work in
the various branches of the Service up to the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
standard of efficiency, in avoiding mistakes by
learning the experience of others, and in correlating
and summarizing work done on similar problems in
widely different regions.</p>

<h3>HOW THE FOREST SERVICE APPROPRIATION IS ALLOTTED TO THE NATIONAL FORESTS</h3>

<p>It is, indeed, a great task to distribute the money
that is each year appropriated by Congress for the
Forest Service so that the Washington Office, the
District Offices, and the 147 National Forests each
get their just share and so that each dollar buys the
greatest amount of good for the whole people without
extravagance or waste. To do this a large organization
has been built up composed of business
men who have absolutely no selfish interest at heart
and among whom graft or favoritism is unknown
and unheard of. It may be said without exaggeration
that the business of the National Forests is on
a thoroughly sound and efficient basis.</p>

<p><i>Forest Service Expenses.</i> While for reasons already
spoken of, the cash receipts are considerably
below the expenses for running the Forests, the
rapidly increasing system of roads, trails and telephone
lines points not only to a constantly increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
use and service to the public but also as a consequence
to increased financial returns.</p>

<p>The expenses of the Forest Service on the National
Forests are of a two-fold character. There
are costs of administration and protection on the
one hand which might be called ordinary running
expenses, and the costs of improvements, reforestation,
and forest investigations on the other. The
latter are really in the nature of investments, and
do not properly fall into the category of operating
costs. Yet they are absolutely necessary to the
welfare of the Forests. They comprise expenditures
for roads, trails, telephone lines, and similar
improvements, the establishment of forests by the
planting of young trees which have been destroyed
by past fires, the carrying on of research and experiments
to aid in the development of the best
methods of forestry, and expenses connected with
the classification and segregation of agricultural
lands in the Forests. The establishment of permanent
boundaries and the cost of making homestead
and other surveys are also in the nature of
investments. Such expenditures may be looked
upon as money deposited in the bank to bear interest;
they will not bring direct financial returns now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
but will produce great revenue many years hence.</p>

<p><i>The Agricultural Appropriation Bill.</i> The fiscal
year in the Forest Service extends from July
1 of one year to June 30 of the next. Every
year, in the Agricultural Appropriation Bill that
comes before Congress, there is an appropriation
for the Forest Service for its work. This appropriation
is not in a lump sum but by allotments or
funds. There is the fund for Fire Fighting, one
for General Expenses, another for Statutory Salaries,
another for Improvements, another for Emergency
Fire conditions, and usually there are special
appropriations for various purposes. For the fiscal
year 1918 (extending from July 1, 1917, to June
30, 1918) there are special appropriations for Land
Classification, for purchasing land under the Weeks
Law, for coöperative fire protection under the
Weeks Law, and for the Federal Aid Road Act.</p>

<p><i>The Ranger's Protection and Improvement
Plans.</i> Long before this bill reaches Congress
every Forest Ranger on every National Forest,
every Forest Supervisor, and every Branch of the
Washington and the District Offices have been estimating
how much money they will need to carry
out the plans proposed for the next fiscal year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Each Forest Ranger works and studies over his
plans for the next year with which he hopes to protect
his district from fire. He plans and figures
out what improvements are urgently necessary to
make the remote parts of his district more accessible.
He tries to arrive at a safe estimate of the
cost of so many miles of trails, roads, and telephone
lines, so many cabins, barns, corrals, etc., which he
thinks are absolutely essential to the proper administration
of his district, and he estimates the number
of Forest Guards, lookout men, and patrol men he
will need for the protection of his territory. Usually
these items are summed up under his annual
Improvement Plan and his Protection Plan respectively.</p>

<p><i>The Supervisor's Plans.</i> When the Forest Supervisor
receives such estimates and plans from each
of his Forest Rangers he studies them over carefully
and tries to decide in an impartial way what
improvements are most necessary in each Ranger
district and what additional men are necessary for
the adequate protection of the region in question.
He carefully weighs the arguments for and against
each expenditure and decides what improvements
must be made now and which ones it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
possible to postpone for one or more years without
detriment to the work of his Forest as a whole.
For in most cases the amount of necessary work to
be done on each Ranger district is far in excess of
the amount which the Forest Supervisor could approve
owing to the inadequacy of the Forest Service
funds. So, for the Forest Supervisor, it is
merely a question of how low he can keep his estimates
for money for the ensuing year until such a
time when Congress will appropriate more money
so that all the important and necessary work can
be done. In most cases therefore the major part
of all the expenditures recommended by the Forest
Ranger is warranted, but the Forest Supervisor
knows that he must cut all the estimates down considerably
in order to bring the total Forest estimate
reasonably near the amount he is likely to get, basing
his judgment upon what he got the year before.</p>

<p><i>Approval of Plans by the District Forester.</i>
The District Forester then gets the National Forest
estimate from every one of his 25 or 30 Forest
Supervisors and he in turn must decide what projects
on each Forest are immediately necessary and
which ones can be postponed. The same process
is repeated in the Washington office when all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
estimates from the District Foresters are received,
and the Forester in turn sends to the Secretary of
Agriculture his estimates by allotments or funds,
which in turn are put before Congress. While
Congress sometimes makes minor changes in the
Forest Service appropriation, in most cases the bill
is passed as it stands.</p>

<p><i>The District Fiscal Agent.</i> The money appropriated
by Congress is allotted to each district, and
in turn to each National Forest and finally to each
Ranger district by funds, such as General Expenses,
Fire Fighting, Improvements, etc. In each
district the financial matters are taken care of in the
Office of Accounts by the District Fiscal Agent.
He is the Assistant of the Chief of the Forest Service
Branch of the Division of Accounts of the Department
of Agriculture and pays all the bills incurred
by the district and receives all the money
which comes in from the sale of National Forest
resources. The amount of money appropriated for
the district is credited to him and he disburses this
appropriation in accordance with the Fiscal Regulations
of the Department of Agriculture. No
other officer is allowed to receive money for the sale
of timber, forage, or other resources; in fact no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
other official in the District handles any of the
Forest Service funds whatsoever.</p>

<p>All remittances by users of the National Forests
are made to the <span class="locked">U. S.</span> District Depository. If a
rancher has bought some timber from a Forest
Ranger, he is given a letter of transmittal showing
the amount of the purchase which he must send to
the District Fiscal Agent with the amount necessary
to pay for the timber. The letter of transmittal
explains the purpose of the remittance.</p>

<p><i>Tax Money Paid to the States.</i> Another interesting
feature of the National Forest business is the
money paid each State out of the annual receipts
in lieu of taxes. It must be remembered that National
Forests do not pay taxes to the States in
which they are located. On the other hand, if the
National Forests were private property they would
bring into the county and state treasuries yearly
taxes. To compensate the State for the taxes lost
in this way each National Forest pays to each
county in proportion to the area of the National
Forest lands located in that county a sum of money
equal to 25 per cent, of the total gross receipts
each fiscal year. From the receipts of the fiscal
year 1917 this amounts to about $850,000. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
provided that this money is to be expended for
schools and roads in the county in which the National
Forests lie. Recently a law was passed giving
the Secretary of Agriculture authority to expend
an additional 10 per cent. of the National Forest
receipts for the construction of roads and trails
for the benefit of local communities. From the
fiscal year 1917 this amounts to about $340,000.
These moneys for roads, trails, and schools are of
course a great benefit to the mountain communities,
since usually the amount of taxable property in
such remote localities is small and hence the amount
of taxes received is small. These allotments to the
counties have helped to develop the communication
systems of local communities and have also made
the National Forests more accessible and useful.</p>

<h3>THE EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES FOR THE NATIONAL FORESTS</h3>

<p><i>The Property Auditor and Property Clerk.</i>
The depot for equipment, supplies, and blank forms
is located at Ogden, Utah, and this office furnishes
all the Forests in all the districts with most of the
equipment necessary. The record of the property
of the United States in the custody of the Forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Service is kept by a man called the Property
Auditor. Requisitions for supplies and equipment
are made by the Forest Supervisor to the Property
Clerk. Government property is considered expendable
or non-expendable depending upon its
character. Each Forest has a Property Custodian
who has charge of all the property assigned to the
Forest. When property is received from the
Property Clerk or if property is transferred from
one forest officer to another, the Property Custodian
must note the change on his records.</p>

<p><i>Blank Forms.</i> The blank forms which are supplied
by the Property Clerk are printed standard
forms used in issuing permits, making contracts,
reports, examinations, timber sale agreements, in
short, those used in almost every business transaction
of the Forest Service. Even timber estimates,
tree measurements, and other similar public records
are kept on standard printed forms for permanent
uniform record.</p>

<p><i>Supplies.</i> Supplies such as stationery, typewriters,
pencils, ink, notebooks, paper for map
work, compasses, measuring tapes, and a host of
other articles are furnished upon requisition by the
Property Clerk. Equipment such as filing cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
tables, chairs, typewriters, tree-measuring instruments,
tents, cooking utensils, surveying instruments,
snow shoes, skiis, knapsacks, water buckets,
canteens, kodaks, and many other forms of equipment
are furnished by the Property Clerk, although
in cases of emergency some of these things may be
purchased locally by Forest officers by the authority
of the Forest Supervisor.</p>

<h3>NATIONAL FOREST IMPROVEMENTS</h3>

<p><i>The Need of Improvements.</i> It is but natural,
from their situation, that the National Forests represent
pioneer conditions; conditions that one might
expect to find in a wild, rugged, mountainous country.
This was true to an extreme degree when the
National Forests were first established and it is true
in a very large degree even to-day, since the amount
of time and money which it will be necessary to
expend on the construction of improvements on the
155,000,000 acres of National Forests is something
enormous. For a long time to come, then, the National
Forests will need improvements in order to
make them secure against fire and in order to make
the resources, now locked up, available. Proper
protection and the fullest use of National Forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
resources depend mainly upon facilities for transportation,
communication, and control. All parts
of the National Forests should be accessible by
roads and trails; there should be telephone communication
between settlements and Forest officers'
headquarters and with the lookout stations; and in
most cases suitable living accommodations must
be provided for the field force. For the fullest use
of the forage resources, water for the live stock must
be developed and range fences constructed; to reduce
the hazard and the cost and difficulty of controlling
forest fires, firebreaks and other works
must be constructed.</p>

<p><i>Transportation Facilities.</i> Adequate facilities
for travel and transportation are of first importance.
Steam roads, electric roads, and boat lines
are utilized in the National Forest transportation
system as well as the existing roads and trails.
Added to this, new roads and trails are being constructed
every year to complete the already existing
network.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 212px;">

<div class="caption">Figure 13. A forest fire lookout tower on Leek Springs Mountain.

</div></div>

<p>The need for new roads and trails depends upon
the number of them already existing, the value of
the resources that it is necessary to make accessible,
the fire liability, and the amount of unrealized revenues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
due to lack of transportation facilities. If
valuable grazing land or timber land can be made
accessible there is good reason for building a new
road. In many cases roads and trails are built to
facilitate the protection of large remote areas from
fire. Such areas may have large bodies of valuable
timber which if destroyed by forest fires would
involve a heavy loss. Even aside from valuable
timber on an area, it is absolutely necessary when a
forest fire breaks out to get to it with men and fire-fighting
equipment in the shortest possible time
before it spreads. If the fire gets to be a large
one, many men with provisions, tents, fire-fighting
tools, and other equipment must be transported to
the scene of the fire. Any delay in the transportation
of these things may prove fatal and may result
in an uncontrollable conflagration.</p>

<p>The transportation system that is proposed for a
National Forest, if the one that exists is inadequate,
is usually planned many years ahead. The ultimate
or ideal system is always kept in mind so that
every mile of road or trail that is constructed is
made a part of it. If not enough money is available
for a good road, a trail is built along the line
of the proposed road. Later this trail is widened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
into a permanent road. The Engineer connected
with each District Office usually has charge of laying
out big road projects. A few miles of permanent,
good, dirt road with good grade is always preferred
to many miles of poor road with heavy grade and
improper drainage. A road and trail system is
planned for each National Forest which will eventually
place every portion of the Forest within a
distance of at least 7-1/2 miles of a wagon road. A
pack-train can then transport supplies from the
point to which they are delivered on the wagon
road to any field camp and return in a single day.</p>

<p>In trail and road construction it is very often
necessary to build bridges. Sometimes a very simple
log bridge meets the need, but in bridging many
large mountain torrents, which become very high
and dangerous in the spring, large bridges are
necessary. Cable suspension bridges and queen
and king truss bridges are built where occasion
arises for them, but only after being planned in
detail and after the District Forester has approved
their design and method of construction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;">
<img id="fig_14" src="images/i_12.jpg" width="564" height="370" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption">Figure 14. A typical Forest ranger's headquarters. Idlewood Ranger Station, Arapaho National
Forest, Colorado
</div></div>

<p>Very often navigable streams and lakes are used
as a part of the transportation system on a National
Forest. On the Tahoe National Forest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
California launches are operated by the Forest
Service on Lake Tahoe to patrol the region around
the lake for forest fires. Ferries, boats, and
launches belonging to private companies or individuals
are used by agreement or if necessary are
bought by the Service from the Improvement
funds. Speeders, motor cars, and hand cars on
railroads or logging roads are often used when an
agreement has been made with the company. In
this way railroads are made a part of the transportation
system of the Forest.</p>

<p><i>Communication Facilities.</i> The system of communication
on the National Forests is scarcely less
important than the system of transportation. This
system includes telephone lines, signal systems, and
mail service. The telephone system, as can be
readily seen, is of the utmost importance for the
transaction of all kinds of National Forest business.
In case a Forest Ranger wishes to speak to
his Supervisor about controlling a large fire, it
makes a great difference whether he can talk to
him over the telephone or whether he must send a
messenger on horseback perhaps 60 or 70 miles.
In the former case practically no time is lost, in
the latter it would take at least two days for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
messenger to reach the Forest Ranger, and in the
meantime the fire would continue to rage and
spread.</p>

<p>In the absence of a telephone system a signal
system is used. The one probably used the most
in forest fire protection work is the heliograph, by
which code messages are sent from one point to
another by means of a series of light flashes on a
mirror. The light of the sun is used and the flashes
are made by the opening and closing of a shutter
in front of the mirror. Very often these heliograph
stations are located on mountain tops in the
midst of extremely inaccessible country. Where
there are a number of these stations at least one is
connected by telephone to the Forest Supervisor's
office. When the Forest officer at the telephone
gets a heliograph message about a certain fire he
immediately telephones the news directly to the
Forest Ranger in whose district the fire is located,
or if he does not happen to be in direct communication
with the Forest Ranger he notifies the Forest
Supervisor, who then notifies the officer concerned.
Of course it is all prearranged who should be notified
in case a fire is reported to the heliograph man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<img id="fig_15" src="images/i_13.jpg" width="369" height="491" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption">Figure 15. A typical view of the National Forest country in Montana.

</div></div>

<p>Unfortunately it has been found that this system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of communication is not satisfactory even under
favorable conditions. This system depends upon
direct sunlight; without it is useless. When there
is much smoke in the air it is also of uncertain
value. The heliograph system has perhaps reached
its greatest development upon the California National
Forest, but even here experience has shown
that it is only a temporary makeshift and the plan
is to replace it by a telephone system as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>The Forest Supervisor, especially in his summer
headquarters, depends directly upon the mail service
for communication with the District Forester
and the outside world. In many cases the fact that
the Forest Supervisor has his headquarters in a
small mountain community in the summer has
made it possible for that community to receive a
daily mail service or mail at least three times a week.
When the Forest Supervisor becomes satisfied that
mail service is desirable in certain mountain communities
he investigates local settlers' needs for
mail facilities; or he may coöperate with the people
in the nearest village who are petitioning for mail
service. Often his influence proves the deciding
factor in getting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
As I have said before, telephone communication
is indispensable to fire protection and to quick and
efficient methods of conducting National Forest
business. Not only do Forest Service lines enter
into the National Forest telephone system but all
private lines are also made use of. By coöperative
agreements with private companies the National
Forest lines are used by private companies, in return
for which private lines are used by the Forest
Service. In this way a complete network of telephone
lines is established connecting not only the
Forest Supervisor with all his Rangers and his forest
fire lookout stations, but also connecting each
one of these with local communities and the large
towns at a distance. Thus, when a forest fire occurs
and the available local help is not sufficient to control
the fire the telephone system is put to use to call
help from the nearest villages and towns.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 16. Forest Rangers repairing a bridge over a mountain stream.

</div></div>

<p><i>Grazing Improvements.</i> It is often necessary
for the complete and economical use of the forage
on a National Forest to coöperate with the local
stockmen to develop range by constructing improvements.
Water may have to be developed;
fences, corrals, bridges, trails, and other works may
have to be constructed. Often cattle belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
different stockmen are grazed on adjacent areas
which are not separated by natural boundaries such
as rivers, ridges, or swamps. If there is no obstacle
to prevent the cattle from drifting from one range
into another, a drift fence is built, thus definitely
separating one stockman's range from the other.
Often good range would remain unused on account
of lack of water altogether or on account of lack of
water during the dry season only. In this case the
Forest Service usually coöperates with the stockmen
to provide water. Roads, trails, and bridges
are often necessary to enable sheep and cattle to
reach range lands.</p>

<p><i>Protective Improvements.</i> Ranger stations,
cabins, lookout stations, firebreaks and similar
works are required to protect the forests from fire
and are known as protective improvements. Buildings
are constructed for the field force to afford
necessary shelter and to furnish an office for the
efficient transaction of business. Land is often
cultivated for the production of forage crops and
fences are built to insure necessary pasturage for
live stock used by the Forest officers in their work.
The buildings may be substantial houses to be used
throughout the year or they may be merely such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
structures as will afford the necessary shelter and
domestic conveniences for Forest officers in the
summer. These summer camps are constructed
where needed for the use of patrolmen, officers engaged
in timber sale work or at such points as will
serve the needs of officers traveling through the
forest. Barns, sheds, and other small structures
are constructed at the Ranger's headquarters when
they are needed. Office buildings are also constructed
for the use of Forest Rangers or for summer
headquarters of the Forest Supervisor.</p>

<p><i>Appropriations for Improvement Work.</i> The
money for the construction of National Forest improvements
is secured from various sources. The
annual Forest Service appropriation usually carries
a considerable sum for this purpose. In the fiscal
year 1918 $450,000 has been appropriated for this
work, which divided among the 147 National Forests
gives an average only of about $3,000 per Forest.
This is really a very small sum considering
the size of the average National Forest. Fortunately
there are other appropriations and funds and
each year sees more money available for this most
important work. Under the law 25 per cent. of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
receipts are paid to the States in which the National
Forests are located to be expended for roads and
schools. The amount to be paid to the States in
this way from the receipts in 1917 is about $848,874.00.
By the acts of Congress organizing them
as States, Arizona and New Mexico also receive
for their schools funds an additional share of the
receipts based on the proportion that their school
lands within the National Forests bear to the total
National Forest area in the States. The approximate
amounts due on account of the receipts for
1917 are $42,844.80 to Arizona and $18,687.56 to
New Mexico. Congress has also provided that 10
per cent, of the receipts shall be set aside as an
appropriation to be used under the direction of the
Secretary of Agriculture for road and trail building
in National Forests in coöperation with state
authorities or otherwise. The amount thus appropriated
on account of the fiscal year 1917 receipts is
$339,549.61. This added to the amount carried
over from the 1916 receipts fund, $136,981.23, and
the amount appropriated for improvements, in the
regular Agricultural Appropriation Bill, $450,000.00,
brings the total available for the construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of roads, trails, cabins, bridges, telephone lines,
etc., on the National Forests for the fiscal year 1918
to $926,530.84.</p>

<p>There is still another fund recently appropriated
which will enable roads and trails to be built on a
very much larger scale than hitherto has been possible
and will result in the rapid opening of forest
regions at present practically inaccessible. The
Federal Aid Road Act, passed by Congress in 1916,
appropriated ten million dollars for the construction
and maintenance of roads and trails within
or partly within National Forests. This money
becomes available at the rate of a million dollars a
year until 1927. In general, the States and counties
are required to furnish coöperation in an amount
at least equal to 50 per cent. of the estimated cost of
the surveys and construction of projects approved
by the Secretary of Agriculture. The apportionment
among the States is based on the area of National
Forest lands in each State and the estimated
value of the timber and forage resources which the
Forests contain.</p>

<p>The total amount from all sources available for
roads, trails, and other improvements on the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Forests during the fiscal year 1918 is therefore
$1,926,530.84.</p>

<h3>THE CLASSIFICATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF NATIONAL FOREST LANDS</h3>

<p>The classification and consolidation of National
Forest lands is a matter of great importance to
their proper administration and protection. If all
the lands within the Forests are to be put to their
highest use for the permanent good of the whole
people the lands inside of their boundaries must be
classified and permanent boundaries established for
each Forest. Through this kind of work the National
Forests gain in stability. The classification
and segregation of the agricultural lands is most
important, for these lands are open to entry under
the Forest Homestead Act.</p>

<p><i>Land Classification.</i> The land classification
work is organized in the Washington and District
Offices under the Branch of Lands. Crews of men
are sent out from the District Offices and the work
of classification, carefully planned ahead, is done by
projects, that is, large contiguous areas are examined
together. For instance, the Hat Creek Project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
on the Lassen National Forest consisted of a
number of large areas containing scattered parcels
of agricultural lands along the Hat Creek valley
in that Forest. For the classification of the lands
on a big project a surveyor and a lineman, one or
more timber cruisers, and an expert from the Bureau
of Soils constitute the crew. As a result of
this work over 1,100 individual tracts within the
Forests were made available for entry under the
Forest Homestead Act during the fiscal year 1916,
because this land was found to have a greater value
for growing agricultural crops than for growing
timber. Under this same policy since 1912 about
12,000,000 acres were eliminated from the Forests,
partly because they were of greater value for agricultural
use, or because they were not suited for the
purposes for which the National Forests were created.
Up to June 30, 1917, 127,156,610 acres of
National Forest land have been examined and classified.
Such work as this, once and for all time,
will settle the controversy now and then waged in
Congress by certain Congressmen that the National
Forests have large and valuable tracts of agricultural
lands locked up within their boundaries and
therefore should be abolished, or turned over to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
States, or equally radical disposition made of them.
Such Congressmen usually are working for some
predatory private interests who want to secure the
great wealth in the National Forests that is being
wisely conserved for the people.</p>

<p><i>The Consolidation of National Forest Lands.</i>
There has also been a great need for consolidating
the National Forest lands where these were interspersed
with private or state lands. Congress has
recognized this need and from time to time has
granted authority to exchange lands with private
owners or States where such an exchange would be
advantageous to the Government through the resulting
consolidation of holdings. Thus by getting
the government lands into a more compact body
their administration and protection are materially
facilitated in many ways.</p>

<p>Before any exchange is made it must be ascertained
that the land which the Government is to
receive has equal value with that relinquished, also
that the land is chiefly valuable for the production
of timber and the protection of stream flow. Recent
additions to the Whitman National Forest in
Oregon consisted of privately owned cut-over timberland
rapidly reproducing to valuable timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
trees. Title to this will be secured by exchange for
government owned lands.</p>

<h3>HOW YOUNG FORESTS ARE PLANTED TO REPLACE THOSE DESTROYED BY FIRE</h3>

<p><i>Reforestation and the Timber Supply.</i> More
than 15,000,000 acres of National Forest lands
which are capable of producing timber and valuable
chiefly for that purpose have been denuded of their
original tree growth. These lands are not adapted
to agriculture and possess but a small value for
grazing. In their present condition they are practically
unproductive barrens.</p>

<p>It is probable that one-half of this area will reforest
itself naturally through the reseeding of
burns, and the encroachment of tree growth upon
natural openings, parks, grass lands, and brush
lands. This natural extension of the forest on such
areas is progressing at the estimated rate of 150,000
acres annually. The remaining half of the denuded
area, 7,500,000 acres, must be reforested by
artificial means. This land is unquestionably
adapted to growing timber and useful to the nation
primarily for that purpose. Every year that it lies
idle the country suffers a great financial loss, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
such an immense area is capable of growing at least
three-quarters of a billion feet of timber annually.
It was recently estimated that the timberlands on
the National Forests are producing between five
and six billion feet of lumber annually by growth.
The complete restocking of the areas now denuded
or sparsely timbered will increase the annual production
of wood at least 25 per cent., an item
certainly worth considering.</p>

<p><i>Reforestation and Water Supply.</i> Even more
important than the value of the timber which is lost
annually is the part which these large areas play in
the conservation of water supply. Most of this
area is on the watersheds of western streams and
rivers and the fact that it is denuded is a dangerous
menace to the equable flow of the rivers which drain
those areas. The National Forests contain over
1,175 watersheds which supply many municipalities,
324 water-power projects, and 1,266 irrigation
projects, aside from many other outside power and
irrigation projects which are fed by watersheds
within the Forests. The cities of Salt Lake City,
Utah; Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado;
Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, all derive
their municipal water supply from streams arising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in the National Forests. The proposed water
system for the city of San Francisco, California, is
also to be taken from the National Forest streams.
A few years ago planting was undertaken on the
watershed of the Colorado Springs, Colorado, reservoir.
This water supply is worth annually from
$80,000 to $100,000. Besides this the 2,000 horsepower
hydro-electric plants are valued at $40,000
and the 40,000 undeveloped horsepower are said to
have an additional value of $400,000, making the
total value of the watershed more than $500,000,
with the probability that a greater water supply
having a far greater value will be needed as the city
grows.</p>

<p>And there are many evidences that the people of
the West have begun to realize that the National
Forests are the key to the entire water-supply situation
in the West no matter for what purpose the
water is used. The public consideration now being
given to flood control, the requests from many western
cities for special measures to protect their municipal
water supply, the concern expressed by irrigation
associations in Colorado and elsewhere, lest
even the regulated cutting on the National Forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
may reduce stream flow, and the rapid rate at which
unused reservoir and power sites in the Forests are
being developed, all are evidences of the importance
of Forests in protecting water supplies. Reforestation
is essential so that the National Forests
can effectively discharge this function.</p>

<p><i>Government Reforestation Policy.</i> The duty of
the Forest Service to put the denuded areas which
will not be reforested naturally into a condition of
productivity admits of no further argument. But
the problem is not so easily solved as it is made
clear. Under the semi-arid conditions prevailing
on many National Forests this work involves uncertainties
and unsolved problems. On the National
Forests artificial reforestation was an untried
field when the Forest Service entered it. The Government
therefore had to develop its own practice
in the face of a great variety of conditions, largely
unfavorable. The situation still calls for intensive
experiments to develop the best methods from the
standpoint of both cost and results. More than
that, it calls for a different set of methods for each
forest region of the West which has its peculiar
trees, climate, and soils. Then, lastly, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
proper methods have been demonstrated by experiment,
the new methods can be applied on a large
scale with a very good chance for success.</p>

<p>Therefore intensive experiments must come first.
Business prudence requires the development of all
methods in detail and reasonable certainty as to
their results before large sums are expended upon
field operations. In the least favorable regions like
the semi-arid mesas of the Southwest, the work is
restricted for the present to small, carefully conducted
experiments, the result sought being reliable
information upon how to proceed rather than
the reforestation of many acres. In the most favorable
regions, as the western slopes of the Rocky
Mountains and the Cascade Ranges, the results already
obtained have been so excellent, due to an
unusual combination of good growing conditions,
that operations upon a larger scale have been justified
simultaneously with continued intensive investigations.
As the work is extended into each new
region or new National Forest, the most favorable
sites are always chosen first. After the possibilities
and limitations of each method have been ascertained
by experience under the best conditions of
each locality the work can either be intelligently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
extended or restricted. But the work is always
conducted from the standpoint of the maximum return
for each dollar expended.</p>

<p>In accordance with the policy outlined by the
Forest Service watersheds used for municipal supply
or irrigation continue to receive first consideration.
Large sums are not, however, being spent on
such watersheds where any uncertainty as to the
outcome exists; that is before successful methods
have been perfected by experiment. In addition to
watersheds, reforestation work is being conducted
for the primary object of producing timber only
where climatic conditions and other factors are extremely
favorable. As far as possible these areas
are being selected with reference to the low cost of
the work, natural conditions which insure rapid tree
growth, and urgent local need for additional timber
supplies. These favorable conditions generally obtain
in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Minnesota,
and Michigan and it is in these States that
the best results have been obtained. In California,
Utah, Nevada, Colorado, and the Southwest the
work is restricted to intensive experiments on a
small scale, until successful methods of meeting
the adverse local conditions have been perfected.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Reforestation.</i> Two general methods
of reforestation have been developed. The
first is called the direct seeding method, in which
tree seed is sown upon the ground with or without
simple forms of cultivation. The other method is
the planting method by which seedlings are grown
in nurseries under ideal conditions of soil, light,
and moisture until they are large enough to be
transplanted and stand the rigors of the open field.
Direct seeding, where successful, is the cheaper
method, but is necessarily limited to sites whose
soil and moisture conditions are exceptionally favorable
to tree growth. The inability of the newly
germinated seedling to establish itself except in
comparatively moist soil makes the success of this
method on the semi-arid mesas of the Southwest,
for example, very problematical, especially since
these localities are subject to long dry seasons. In
such localities the use of the direct seeding method
must be restricted to experiments designed to determine
the exact range of conditions under which it
is feasible. The main effort, however, of the Forest
Service has been given to direct seeding on areas
where reasonable success appears to be assured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The planting of 2 or 3 year old seedlings or transplants
largely overcomes the adverse soil and moisture
factors which appear to have made direct seeding
unsuccessful in many localities. This method,
which is the general practice in European forestry,
must without doubt be employed to reforest a considerable
portion of the denuded lands. The
growing and planting of nursery stock is carried on
simultaneously with direct seeding. The object of
this is to ascertain the comparative results of the
two methods, the sites on which the greater success
will be obtained from each, and the proper relation
of the two methods in the future development of
reforestation work.</p>

<p>Since reforestation work was begun on the National
Forests about 135,500 acres have been sowed
or planted. The larger part of this acreage
was reforested by direct seeding. Until only a few
years ago larger areas were direct seeded each year
than were planted to nursery stock, but at the present
time more planting is being done. During the
fiscal year 1916 about 7,600 acres were planted and
about 2,800 acres were seeded. The average cost
in that year of planting was about $10.00 per acre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that of the seeding was about $4.50 per acre. The
1917 costs were slightly higher, due to the increased
cost of labor and supplies.</p>

<p>The reforesting methods of the Forest Service
mean the collection of large quantities of seeds and
the growing of large quantities of small trees for
planting. Since 1911 the Forest Service has collected
over 175,000 pounds of seeds for its direct
seeding and planting work. During the fiscal year
1916 the Forest Service had 14 large tree-nurseries
and 7 small ones, which had in them over 37 million
young trees which would, in a short time, be planted
in the field. From these figures it is readily seen
that the reforestation work on the National Forests
is conducted on a large scale.</p>

<p><i>Direct Seeding Work on the National Forests.</i>
The direct seeding work on the National Forests
involves many more problems than one would at
first thought suppose. Seed must be collected and
extracted; it must be stored, if it is not used immediately;
if the seed is sown it must be protected
from rodents and very often the ground must be
prepared before the seed is sown.</p>

Forests of the West.
</div></div>

<p>Seeds are collected in various ways. Often
cones are purchased at advertised rates from persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
who make a business of seed collecting. The
collectors deliver the cones to a specified Ranger
station or to some seed extracting plant. But such
collectors are not always available. Seed is collected
by Forest officers by stripping cones directly
from standing trees or from those felled in logging
operations. Large quantities are also gathered
from the vast stores or caches assembled by squirrels.</p>

<p>Seed extraction is usually done most economically
by experienced Forest officers. It requires
drying by exposure to natural or artificial heat to
open the cones; threshing to separate the seed from
the scales and woody portions of the cone; and
cleaning or fanning to remove chaff and dirt.
Much of the extraction has hitherto been done in
small quantities at a large number of stations and
with very simple home-made appliances. In view
of the large amount of seed which must be handled
each year the cost of extraction has been materially
reduced and seed of higher average fertility has
been obtained by concentrating the major part of
the work at central seed-extracting plants equipped
with improved machinery.</p>

<p>A problem of great importance from the standpoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of final results is that of having seed available
at the season of the year when it is needed.
Past experiments have shown that fall sowing is
essential to success in most parts of the West where
extensive seeding projects will be conducted. Experience
has also shown that seed on a large scale
cannot be extracted in time for use in the same
season. Moreover, every year is not a good seed
year, so that Forest officers must take advantage of
the good years to collect large quantities and store
them for use during years of seed shortage. Purchased
domestic or foreign seed cannot be used to
advantage to make up these deficiencies because it
is sometimes of poor quality and not adapted to the
climatic conditions in which it must be sown. For
these reasons methods had to be devised for storing
large quantities of seeds for several years at a time
and in such a manner that their vitality would not
be impaired. Many storage tests have been made
by the Forest Service to determine the best way of
storing seeds. The tests showed that the sealed
glass jar is the best container and that seed must
be stored either in air-tight receptacles or at low
temperatures to be kept for any considerable period
without loss of fertility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Probably the greatest obstacle encountered in reforestation
by direct seeding is the destruction of
the seeds by rodents. The failure of many direct
seeding projects has been due primarily to loss from
this cause. Failure has occurred on areas of practically
every character regardless of the time of the
year the seed was sown. Success has been encountered
only where recent burns had largely
eliminated the animals either by outright destruction
or by the loss of food supply. The rodents
which are most destructive to tree seeds are the
ground squirrels, the chipmunks, the mice, and the
gophers. It is not strange that they should seek
out the seed that has been carefully sown by the
Forest officers. In many cases these seeds are their
natural food and they are wonderfully diligent and
expert in searching it out.</p>

<p>In coöperation with the Biological Survey, the
Forest Service has worked on the problem of destroying
the rodents. Many methods have been
tried out in the field. The free use of grain poisoned
with strychnine has thus far produced the
best results and has reduced the loss from rodents
sufficiently to secure satisfactory germination.
The successful elimination of such injury appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to lie in the thorough poisoning by this method of
areas to be seeded, once or oftener in advance of
sowing.</p>

<p>With successful germination assured by the collection
of good seed and the protection of it after
it has been sowed from rodents, the next problem
lies in cheap methods of cultivation and sowing.
This will enable the young seedling to develop its
root system early enough and rapidly enough to
withstand the first annual drought, the dominant
feature of the climate of all the western National
Forests.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There are numerous methods used in sowing tree
seed on the National Forests. Three general
methods are used in most of the work. Broadcast
sowing is practiced in the fall and spring or upon
the snow in the winter, both on ground that has
not been prepared and on soil that has been scarified
by rough brush drags, harrowing, disking, or
partial or complete plowing. In seed-spot sowing
the seed is planted at regular intervals in small
spots where the soil is cleared of vegetation and
worked up loose to a depth of from 5 to 6 inches.
When corn planting or dibbling is practiced the
seed is thrust into the soil by a hand corn-planter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
or, in the case of large nuts, pressed into holes made
with a pointed stick. The corn-planter method is
often combined with the preparation of seed spots
or the plowing of single furrows, in order to plant
the seed in loose soil free from vegetation.</p>

<p>On a large majority of the Forests broadcast
seeding on unprepared ground has not succeeded.
As a rule satisfactory stands have been secured
from broadcasting only after an expensive preliminary
cultivation which would be impracticable in
extended operations and which would exceed the
cost of planting with nursery stock. But broadcasting
on prepared strips and upon recent burns
has given some success. The seed-spot method has
been most successful if done at the proper season.
Late summer and early fall sowing has produced
better results than sowing in spring or winter. As
a whole direct seeding has not succeeded, especially
when the results and costs of the work are
compared with the planting of nursery stock.
Planting has thus far yielded better results, especially
on the less favorable areas. Furthermore,
from the standpoint of final results attained, planting
has actually been cheaper than seeding, in spite
of the greater initial cost of planting. While the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
major emphasis in reforestation work is placed
upon planting, considerable seeding is being done,
but it is confined to the most favorable localities
and sites.</p>

<p><i>Planting on the National Forests.</i> Reforestation
by planting young trees has received much
attention during the last few years principally because
it has produced better results. Much still
remains to be said for both methods and future
experiments alone can decide which method to use
in a specified region and under given conditions of
climate and soil. Usually direct seeding has been
tried first in any given locality where reforestation
work was to be done. In fact the policy of the
Forest Service in artificial reforestation on the
National Forests has been, first, to conduct experiments
to find out what can be done and what is the
best way to do it; second, to reforest by direct seeding
wherever this is feasible; and third, to plant
nursery seedlings where direct seeding has been
found too uncertain.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In selecting areas for planting, preference is
usually given to the watersheds of streams important
for irrigation and municipal water supply
and to land which is capable of producing heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
stands of a quick-growing species or of a specially
valuable species. Next in importance are areas
which offer good opportunities for object lessons to
the public in the practice of forestry. Some areas
offer combinations of advantages. For instance, a
burned-over tract may be suitable for planting to
some rapid-growing species which is also valuable
for timber and at the same time may be situated so
that it will serve as an object lesson also. It is on
such areas in general that reforestation by planting
is being concentrated.</p>

<p>While the reforestation of the watersheds of
streams important for irrigation and municipal
water supply has a large financial value, this value
is hard to estimate because it involves not actual
cash profit but loss prevented. But when a favorable
site is planted to a quick-growing, valuable,
species, it is comparatively easy to arrive at a fair
estimate of the possible profit on money invested.
It has been estimated that under many conditions
it is highly profitable to reforest waste lands on the
National Forests by planting. From certain experiments
made it is estimated that a white pine
forest artificially established on a second-class forest
soil in Minnesota, will yield about 46,500 board feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
per acre in 50 years, worth at least $10 per thousand
feet, or $465 per acre. Figuring the cost of
planting and the cost of care and protection per
acre per year at 3 per cent. compound interest gives
a total cost of $34.07 per acre at the time the timber
is cut and a net profit of $8.62 per acre per year.
Douglas fir in the Northwest will produce 81,000
board feet in 80 years, worth at least $8.50 per
thousand feet. After deducting all expenses this
would leave a net profit of $555.30 in 80 years or
about $6.94 per acre per year. These profits are
indeed large, considering that the land is not capable
of producing cereal or vegetable crops profitably.
And it must be remembered that in all the
above calculations all the money invested is earning
3 per cent. compound interest and that the net
profits are the earnings in excess of this 3 per cent.
interest.</p>

<p>The little trees that are set out on the National
Forests every year are produced in large nurseries,
where they are grown by the millions. In these
nurseries the little trees receive the most expert care
from the time the seeds germinate until the time
they are large enough to withstand the rigors of
wind and weather on the barren hillsides of Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Sam's Forests. The seeds are first carefully sown
in seed beds and left to develop in these from
one to three years. At the end of one year they
may be transplanted in nursery rows where they
will have more room to develop. Rapidly growing
species like yellow pine are kept only a year in the
seed bed and perhaps one or two years in the transplant
beds; but slow growing species, like cedar,
must remain in the seed beds two years and
usually two years in the transplant beds. All this
depends upon the species and the site upon which it
is to be planted.</p>

<p>If my reader were to visit the Pikes Peak region
during spring or fall he would doubtless encounter
large gangs of men planting young trees on the
barren mountain slopes. Under the proper supervision
of Forest officers some of the men will be seen
digging holes with a mattock while others are coming
directly behind them with bags or boxes with
wet moss or burlap, containing small trees. These
men are called respectively the diggers and
planters. Two men will plant from 500 to 1,000
trees a day, depending upon how deep the holes
must be dug to accommodate the roots, whether the
ground is bare or covered with sod, whether the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
is mountainous or level, and many other factors.</p>

<p>In this way Uncle Sam plants his denuded areas
in the Forests, so that they will be producing <i>timber</i>
for future generations instead of useless <i>brush</i> or
<i>tree weeds</i>. The great variety of climatic and
topographic conditions included in the National
Forest area makes the problem of tree planting infinitely
complex. Nursery stock must be raised in
each region having similar climatic conditions, and
in each of these regions different methods of planting
must be used, depending upon local conditions.
The semi-arid mesas of Arizona and New Mexico
present different planting problems from the humid
forest regions of Oregon and Washington; the
methods used in the sandhills of Nebraska and the
sand plains of Michigan cannot be applied in full
on the high mountain slopes of Colorado; nor are
the planting problems in the vast chaparral areas of
northern California anything like those encountered
in the mountains of Idaho, or in the prairie States of
the Middle West, or in the Black Hills. Then,
again, the reforestation problems of the chaparral
fields of southern California are more perplexing
than any I have mentioned above.</p>

<h3>THE ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF FOREST EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS</h3>

<p><i>The Need of Scientific Experiments.</i> No science
can make progress without intensive experiments
and investigations, least of all a new science
like forestry. The science of forestry as it has
developed in Europe is several hundred years old,
but the science of forestry as applied to American
conditions is still in the infancy of its development&mdash;probably
not over 20 years old. Therefore we
know very little about our trees, our forests, and the
wood which they produce, and the professional foresters
who handle the scientific work on our
National Forests are very much handicapped. To
supply the needed information about the requirements
of many of our tree species, the uses to which
their wood can be put, and many other related subjects,
the Forest Service has established 8 Forest
Experiment Stations (recently reduced to 6) and
one Forest Products Laboratory. It has become
the business of these institutions to study the laws
governing the life of the tree and the forest and
their effect upon the final product&mdash;wood. The
Experiment Stations are working on the solution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the many problems which confront the Forest officers
in the management and the protection of the
National Forests; while the Forest Products Laboratory
was organized to promote the most profitable
utilization and the most economical disposition of
the forest products of the National Forests. Both
sets of institutions, in doing this, are helping materially
to build up the science of American Forestry,
which even to-day can hardly be said to exist.</p>

<p><i>The Science of Growing Timber.</i> In order to
better understand the many diversified problems
which are being studied at the Forest Experiment
Stations, it is necessary to give the reader a few
ideas concerning the science of forest ecology.
This science is the basis of all problems dealing with
the growing of timber and is therefore a study of
the utmost importance to forestry. Forest ecology
is the study of the relations of trees and forests to
their surroundings. By surroundings (or environment)
we mean all the factors which influence their
growth and reproduction, such as soil temperature,
soil moisture, soil texture, rainfall, light, wind, air
temperature, relative humidity, altitude, slope, exposure,
and surface. Forests, we must remember,
are not warehouses of standing logs; they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
merely aggregations of individual trees; but they
are complex communities of living organisms, which
are affected in many ways by climate and soil and
which, in turn, affect in no small degree the climatic
and soil conditions in their immediate vicinity. The
forester cannot treat the forest as an aggregation
of individuals, for forests have laws which govern
their behavior which are entirely different from
those that govern the individual tree. Some foresters
and botanists prefer to call this science by
the name of "tree sociology," and they compare it
with human sociology. Individuals, as we well
know, are governed by different natural laws than
communities. Just so with trees and forests. In
order, therefore, to grow a never-failing supply of
timber intelligently and economically we must understand
these complex organisms and communities,
we must study their behavior under different soil
and climatic conditions and ascertain the conditions
under which they grow best. Only by doing this
can the forester achieve all the objects of forestry,
namely, to help Nature to produce more and better
timber, in a shorter length of time and at the
smallest possible cost.</p>

<p>The experimental work of the Forest Experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Stations is grouped under such categories as
these: dendrological studies, forestation studies,
studies in forest influences, studies relating to forest
management, studies in forest protection, commercial
tree studies, and grazing studies.</p>

<p><i>Dendrological Studies.</i> Dendrological studies
include studies in tree distribution and wood identification.
For each tree species growing in the
United States (and there are about 500 of them) it
is desirable to know its geographical distribution,
its commercial distribution, and its local distribution.
The first of these deals with the entire range
of the tree by geographical divisions; the second of
these with the distribution of those bodies of timber
that are of commercial quantity or size; and the last
deals with the distribution of the tree by local divisions,
such as lowlands, slopes, ridges, valleys,
plateaus, etc. This information is usually placed
on maps for permanent record. Observations by
Forest officers on the many National Forests are recorded
by them and at the first opportunity sent to
Washington. Very often it happens that the range
of a species of tree is considerably extended and
that a tree is found growing in a locality where it
was never reported from before. The identification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of woods is done at the Forest Products Laboratory.
The distinguishing characteristics of the
woods of many American tree species have been determined.
The wood of different trees is studied
under the microscope to discover in what way it
differs from other woods closely related. Many
such results are published for the benefit of both
the lumber dealer and the general public in the
form of bulletins. Both the subject of dyewoods
and that of the many woods now sold as mahogany
have been investigated in this way. The resulting
data have been used by many companies and have
helped to protect the public from frauds.</p>

<p><i>Seed Studies.</i> Experiments in reforestation
are grouped under seed studies, nursery studies,
and sowing and planting. Considerable work has
been done in developing the best methods of seed-extraction.
Much valuable information has been
gathered on the largest amount of seed that may be
extracted from pine cones of different species per
unit of time at different degrees of temperature; the
maximum temperature which may be applied to
seeds of different species without impairing their
vitality; the germinating power of seed extracted at
different temperatures; the comparative length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
time required for the germination of seed extracted
with or without artificial heat; and the most
economical type of seed-extracting plant. Studies
have been made upon the comparative germination
of tree seeds in the field and the greenhouse.
The ultimate success of the plantations being established
on the National Forests in a large degree depends
upon the character of the seed used. Hence
studies are being conducted of the effect of altitude,
soil, age of the tree, density of stand, insect damage
and disease infection, and other factors that affect
the mother tree, upon the character of the seed collected
from those trees, and the growth and form
of the resulting seedling. Also tests to show the
effect of the source of seed on the form and growth
of young seedlings have indicated very clearly that
with all species the seed grown in the locality where
the trees are to be planted give as a rule better results
than seed imported from another region.</p>

<p><i>Nursery Studies.</i> Nursery studies endeavor to
show the most efficient methods for growing young
trees for field planting for each species of trees.
It is of great importance to know how much seed to
sow per foot in the nursery beds; what is the best
time (spring or fall) for sowing; to what depth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
seed should be covered in order to give the highest
germination; whether better results are obtained by
drill sowing or by broadcast sowing; the best
methods of shading, fertilizing, watering, and cultivating
the seed beds; the methods of securing the
best root development of the young seedlings;
the best time and method of transplanting from the
nursery beds to the transplant beds; the best
methods for retarding spring growth in seedlings to
be used at high altitudes; and other problems of
similar nature.</p>

<p><i>Forestation Experiments.</i> Experiments in forestation
have, year after year, proven that planting
is much safer than direct seeding and ultimately less
expensive. For this reason a greater emphasis has
been placed upon planting studies. These studies
have attempted to show the best season for planting
each species; the best methods of planting; the
most advantageous classes of stock to use; and what
the most suitable sites are for each species of tree.</p>

<p><i>Studies of Forest Influences.</i> Studies on the influence
of forests upon stream flow and erosion are
attempting to furnish important data for American
conditions upon this subject. At the Wagon
Wheel Gap Forest Experiment Station in Colorado<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
such a study is being carried on. The purpose of
the study for the first two or three years has been
to determine the character of the two streams which
are to be measured. The forest cover on the two
watersheds is practically identical. The results so
far obtained indicate that the influence upon the
stream flow must be about the same in both cases,
and, consequently, a comparison of these streams
after the denudation of one watershed will be a
very fair test of the influence of the forest cover
upon the relative height of the flood stage and low-water
stage, the amount of erosion, and the rate of
melting of the snow.</p>

<p>Experimental observations which have been conducted
since 1908 at the various Forest Experiment
Stations have shown that the forest exercises a decided
moderating influence upon temperature extremes,
wind motion, and evaporation. Likewise,
the presence of a forest cover retards the melting of
snow in the spring, and in this way huge snowbanks
in the forests feed the nearby streams until late in
the summer. Forests therefore have been shown
to conserve the water supply and also causing this
water to run off slowly rather than in sudden floods.
Studies have also been conducted on determining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the effect of cutting timber upon the climate within
the forest.</p>

<p><i>Meteorological Observations.</i> The climatic requirements
of forest types have been studied at the
Fremont Experiment Station since January 1,
1910, through experimental observations, and other
stations have taken up the same problem since that
date. The first step in this work at the Fremont
has been to obtain a complete meteorological record
as a basis for determining what climatic conditions
are most important in limiting the natural
range of such important species as Yellow pine,
Douglas fir, and Engelmann spruce. The data
collected so far have shown that soil moisture and
soil temperature are the controlling factors in determining
the existence of the three forest types.
It has also been shown what climatic conditions
each of the three types of forest must have in order
to succeed. This work has since been extended to
include other types of forest and a meteorological
station has been established at timber line on Pikes
Peak. This station, which is at approximately
11,500 feet, is equipped with self-recording instruments
to measure the climatic factors which obtain
at that elevation and which mark the uppermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
altitudinal limit of tree growth in that locality.</p>

<p>Such studies as these, based upon systematic
meteorological observations, have an important
bearing on all other forest problems. The data secured
in this way especially assist the technical
foresters in solving the various problems in forest
management, reforestation, fire protection, and
land classification, besides giving positive knowledge
of the environment in which our trees live and
of the factors affecting their growth and reproduction.
These systematic observations are of prime
importance if we ever hope to have a science of
American Forestry.</p>

<p><i>Forest Management Studies.</i> Experiments in
forest management are carried on to determine the
best methods of cutting National Forest timber to
secure natural reproduction and at the same time
to improve the quality and productivity of the remaining
stand. These studies are carried on by
means of permanent sample plots, on which all the
trees are carefully measured and recorded. First
the timber is cut on the plots under different systems
of management, or thinnings or improvement
cuttings are made. An exact record is kept of the
amount of timber removed and of the size and distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of the remaining trees. Measurements
taken at regular intervals show the precise effect of
the method used on each plot. Close observations
of the reproduction which takes place, brush and
other forms of cover which may establish themselves,
and changes in soil conditions are recorded. On
similar sample plots methods of brush disposal,
methods of marking timber for cutting, and thinning
methods are studied. After logging there are
several ways in which the resulting slash may be disposed,
depending upon surrounding conditions.
In some localities the brush must be burned immediately
on account of the fire danger which its presence
involves; in other places it must be removed
because it interferes with reproduction; in still
other places the brush may be scattered over the
area because there is little fire danger and, in fact,
the brush has been found to assist and protect reproduction.
All these possibilities must be determined
by experiments. Likewise in marking timber
for cutting and in thinning practice various
methods are possible, depending upon circumstances,
the most important of which are the requirements
of the species and the density of the
forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Other management studies deal with the determination
by actual measurement of the volumes
of trees and stands, and the growth of trees and the
yields of whole forests. Reliable growth and yield
data for the different species and types are necessary
to properly handle timber sales as well as for
forest management. They are also essential for
determining damages caused by fires and trespass.</p>

<p><i>Forest Protection Studies.</i> Studies in forest
protection endeavor to find the best methods of
protecting the National Forests from fire, grazing,
disease, insects, wind, snow, hail, and animals.
The most efficient protection of the National Forests
from fire calls for an accurate, scientific knowledge
of all the factors that enter into the problem.
Comprehensive studies are undertaken to secure
the basis for a more scientific method of distributing
National Forest fire-protecting funds. The
aim has been to find the degree of intensiveness in
fire protection warranted by timber, forage, and
watershed values, as modified by their susceptibility
to damage by fire. Under the ideal system of allotting
fire-protecting funds, the most valuable resources,
which at the same time are most in danger
of destruction by fire, should receive the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
amount of funds and therefore the greatest amount
of protection. Less valuable resources, less susceptible
to fire danger, should receive protection in
proportion. Other classes of fire protection studies
have to do with the various phases of fire prevention,
fire detection, and fire control. Studies have
also been carried on to determine the rapidity with
which fire spreads in different forest types, and under
a given set of climatic conditions.</p>

<p><i>Protection from Grazing Damage.</i> Studies of
the effects of grazing upon the natural reproduction
of forests are conducted with a view to devising
a system of range control which would minimize
such injury without requiring the total exclusion
of the stock from the range. Studies have shown
that serious damage occurs to seedlings under four
feet in height during the dry season, on areas containing
poor forage, or which have been overgrazed,
or where there was little or no underbrush. It was
found that sheep do twice as much damage as
cattle. Some of the measures that have been
adopted to lessen the injury to reproduction by
sheep and cattle are: the revegetation of overgrazed
areas, reductions in the amount of stock,
provisions for the better distribution of stock by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the regulation of watering places, and the exclusion
of sheep from cut-over areas on which reproduction
is deficient until the seedlings reach a sufficient
height to be out of the reach of the animals.</p>

<p><i>Protection from Insects and Diseases.</i> In coöperation
with the Bureau of Entomology and the
Bureau of Plant Industry the Forest Service is
conducting a large number of studies and investigations
dealing with the insects and diseases that
do destructive damage to forests. The direct result
of these studies will be the gradual eradication
of predaceous insects and dangerous tree diseases
from the valuable timber forests of the Government.
Control measures already taken have
shown the value of exact scientific information.
On the Klamath National Forest some years ago
about 900 acres were treated for insect infestation.
The cost was about $3,000 and the amount of timber
saved by the eradication of the insects was
worth over $600,000. Other studies are carried on
to identify and describe certain classes of insects,
such, for instance, as those that destroy the seeds of
trees in the cones. The various families, genera,
and species of forest insects are studied and described,
and the results are published in the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of monographs. Many of these insects are difficult
to identify and concerning others very little is
known. Investigations on tree diseases have not
made such good progress, because tree diseases are
much more difficult to control. Tree diseases, like
human diseases, must be prevented instead of controlled.
A general survey of the tree diseases
prevalent in the National Forests has been made,
especially in California. Further studies have
brought to light little known or even unknown diseases.
In California, studies have shown that a
certain relation exists between old age and disease.
Incense cedar, for example, seems to become infested
after it reaches maturity at an age of about
150 years.</p>

<p><i>Tree Studies.</i> Commercial tree studies are
made of important tree species. The results are
published in the form of monographs dealing with
the range, silvicultural characteristics, growth,
yield and management of each tree. These studies
bring together all the important facts known about
the tree described, such as: the industrial uses of
the wood, the conditions under which the tree succeeds,
the rate of growth in different situations,
and the most suitable methods of management to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
secure the highest returns. Tables are included
to show the volume of the trees at different ages
and sizes, in cubic feet, in cords, in board feet, etc.
Studies are also made of the life history and requirements
of important forest trees, often in connection
with commercial studies. Such studies
cover: local, geographical, and commercial occurrence
of the species, the species which are associated
with it, the habit of the tree, its soil and climatic
requirements for germination and growth,
and the various matters connected with its reproduction.
Such publications as these give the Forest
officers much valuable information about the trees
with which they are dealing, and also furnish the
only sources of information to students in forest
schools on the characteristics and requirements of
the trees important in forestry in this country.</p>

<p><i>Grazing Investigations.</i> Grazing investigations,
being intimately connected with a great
national industry, have received a considerable
amount of attention. These studies are confined
at present to grazing reconnoissance, the reseeding
of depleted mountain grazing lands, studies in the
best methods of handling sheep on the range,
studies of the effect of grazing on the forest, identification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of range plants, and the systematic elimination
of poisonous range plants and predatory
animals.</p>

<p>Grazing reconnoissance is a stock taking of the
forage possibilities of a certain piece of range land.
This work is usually done by organized parties,
but a small amount is done also by Forest officers in
spare time. This study aims to collect all the important
grazing information, such as: the area of
grazing lands, the kind of forage, the species of
forage plants, the location of streams, springs, and
other watering places for stock, the location of
stock driveways, drift fences, and cabins, the location
of timber lands that do and those that do not
contain forage, and many other matters pertaining
to the grazing of stock. The maps and field data
secured furnish the basis for range improvement
and more intensive range management. Up to
date, over 12,288,885 acres of range lands have
been covered in this way.</p>

<p>All intensive forage and range experiments are
conducted at the Great Basin Experiment Station
on the Manti National Forest. Here intensive
problems are carried on under controlled conditions
and under constant and careful observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and the necessary care and thoroughness is given
to them which could only be given them at a fully
equipped experiment station. All grazing investigations
on the National Forests are carried on
under the direct supervision of this station.</p>

<p>The seeding of depleted grazing lands is accomplished
either by direct artificial seeding or
through rotation grazing. Under the former
method the seed of native or foreign grasses and
other range plants are sown on the range, in the
attempt to increase the forage crop. By rotation
grazing, that is, permitting the stock to feed first
on one area and then on another, the grasses and
forage plants are allowed to recuperate from the
effect of grazing and allowed to reproduce. The
stock is excluded from one area while the seed is
maturing, and after the seed has matured and become
scattered on the area the stock is allowed to
graze on it. As the stock feeds on the plants it
tramples the seed into the ground and thereby furnishes
favorable conditions for the germination of
the seed. There are few parts of the National
Forests that cannot be completely regenerated by
the adoption of either one or the other of these two
methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
To reduce interference with the natural processes
of reforestation, damage to tree growth and watersheds,
depletion of grazing lands, and the waste of
valuable forest resources, it is important to develop
improved methods of managing different kinds of
live stock on different types of land. These new
methods of handling stock have been applied only
to sheep. The lambing of sheep in small inclosures
on the open range has resulted in the saving
of a large percentage of the lambs. The new
method of bedding sheep where they happen to be
at nightfall has been found to have many advantages
over the old system of returning them to an
established bedding ground a number of nights in
succession. The results have been better sheep,
less damage to range, and more feed.</p>

<p>It was not so many years ago that practically
nothing was known about the various plants which
make up the forage crop on the National Forests.
Forest officers could not identify the plants or say
whether they were of value for forage or not.
This made it difficult to secure the use of each range
by the class of stock to which it was best adapted,
to apply deferred and rotation grazing and to
eliminate losses from poisonous plants. This obstacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to efficient range management was overcome
when a system of plant collection and identification
was started by the Forest Service. Some 23,000
specimens of about 3,000 different species have
been collected on the National Forests, identified
by specialists and the collector informed as to the
value of each species. The identification of range
plants is the first step toward securing an intimate
knowledge of the life history of the plant. Such
information as the soil and moisture requirements,
date of flowering and seeding, requirements for reproduction,
and its relation to other range plants
is of the utmost importance if the maximum forage
crop is to be produced on the range each year.
This constitutes the latest stage in the development
of grazing studies.</p>

<p><i>Investigations Dealing with Poisonous Plants
and Predatory Animals.</i> In coöperation with the
Bureau of Plant Industry the study of poisonous
plants and the means for reducing the losses from
them has been undertaken. The death camas, the
lupines, the larkspurs, some of the wild cherries,
locoweed, and practically all species of zygadenus
are plants that have been found to cause death
among stock. While the handling of stock to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
avoid the poison areas can eliminate the losses to a
small extent, it has been found that the most expeditious
remedy is in digging out and destroying
the poisonous plants. On the Stanislaus National
Forest in California, a cattle range of about 14,000
acres, containing about 67 acres of larkspur, was
cleared of this weed at a cost of about $695. The
average loss of cattle in previous years had been
about 34 head. Following the eradication of the
larkspur the loss was 4 head. The net saving was
valued at $1,800. Similar operations are conducted
on other Forests.</p>

<p>The work of the destruction of predatory animals
has been transferred to the hands of the
Bureau of Biological Survey. Formerly special
Forest Service hunters were detailed to hunt the
animals, and these men used to kill about 4,000 a
year. The Biological Survey, however, still furnishes
traps, ammunition and poison for the destruction
of predatory animals to Forest officers, who do
this work in connection with their regular duties.
Bears, coyotes, mountain lions, lynxes, wildcats,
and wolves are the animals that do the most of the
damage. What makes the problem a difficult one
is that the wolf and the coyote, the two species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
which do the greatest damage to game and domestic
stock, are transient visitors on the Forests which
frequent the Forests only when game and stock is
most abundant. They are bred, born, and spend
the greater portion of their lives in the foothills
outside of the National Forests. Under these
conditions the animals killed on the Forests are
quickly replaced by others from outside. For this
reason the matter was handed over to the Biological
Survey, which will destroy these animals
throughout the public domain and the results will
be much more permanent and effective.</p>

<p>Besides the investigations carried on by the Forest
Experiment Stations many studies are carried
on dealing with forest products. The purpose of
the Branch of Forest Research of the Forest Service
is to promote the most profitable and economical
utilization of forest products by means of experiments
and investigations. The work of the
Branch falls into three divisions: National Forest
utilization, the work of the Forest Products Laboratory,
and industrial investigations.</p>

<p><i>National Forest Utilization Experiments.</i> The
work of the proper utilization of the products of
the National Forests is under the supervision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the District Forester and the Assistant District
Forester in charge of Forest Products in the districts.
Only three out of the seven districts have
such an organization. These men have charge of
all problems connected with the use and marketing
of National Forest timber, the construction of
improvements on the Forests, and related administrative
questions. The following problems are included:
studies of existing industries, covering
methods and costs of manufacture, grades, and
other specifications of manufactured products and
the prices obtained for such products; the collection
of market prices, mill scale studies to determine
grades and overrun, and investigations in kiln
drying; waste in existing industries and closer utilization
possible through improved methods; new
uses for National Forest species through wood
preservation; introduction of industries which will
result in closer or more profitable utilization, as the
manufacture of pulp and paper, wood distillation,
turpentining, and the manufacture of secondary
wood products; overcoming prejudices against
particular species or classes of material; general
questions of timber supply and demand, markets
and freight rates; advice and assistance in the construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of National Forest improvements, particularly
in the use of wood preservatives; advice
and assistance to persons on any matter connected
with the utilization of National Forest timber; the
preparation of publications upon subjects covered
by investigations which have practical or scientific
value; and demonstrations of methods or processes
developed by the Forest Service for the benefit of
local communities.</p>

<p>The presence on a Forest of large quantities of
unmarketable timber, or dead timber, or of material
not used in current sales would mean an investigation
of methods for its utilization. Local
problems affecting wood-using industries in manufacturing
or marketing timber, such as sap stain in
lumber, difficulties in seasoning lumber, and the
effect of different silvicultural methods upon the
average grades of lumber manufactured, are also
taken up with the Products experts at the District
Office. Also in the construction of National Forest
improvements the Forest Supervisor may need
assistance in applying wood preservatives to telephone
poles, fence posts, and other material.
Sometimes timber treating plants are erected, if
necessary, to treat not only material used on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
National Forests, but also material used by local
residents near a Forest.</p>

<p>One of the important problems which confronts
the Office of Products in the various National
Forest districts is the utilization of the so-called
low grade or inferior tree species. The terms
"high grade" and "low grade" or "inferior," as
used at present, merely indicate the lumberman's
valuation of the timber from his point of view and
according to his standards of value. If a certain
species will not produce clear lumber, which is
straight-grained, easily worked, and not subject to
splitting or warping, it is at once classed as inferior.
But the Forest Products specialists each year are
making progress in demonstrating that wood, in
order to be of marketable value, does not necessarily
need to be cut in the form of lumber. It is
also being shown that proper methods of drying
lumber make possible the use of inferior woods for
lumber and manufacturing purposes.</p>

<p>The Office of Forest Products in California has
made considerable progress in overcoming the lumberman's
prejudices against the inferior species in
the California National Forests and the species are
beginning to find wider use and to command better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
prices. The discovery that Incense cedar was
valuable for making lead pencils caused the price of
this so-called "inferior" species to jump from an
average of $10 per thousand feet in logs f. o. b.
cars to as high as $16. White fir, a species religiously
avoided by lumbermen in the woods, was
found to have special properties which make it
very valuable as a pulpwood. One mill in California
now uses annually upwards of 30,000 cords
of it for making paper. Lodgepole pine has been
shown to have a great value for telephone and telegraph
poles when treated with preservatives. It
was found to be 12 per cent. stronger than Western
Red cedar, the standard pole timber, has a more
desirable taper and can be shipped for less money.
Many other cases could be cited from this and other
National Forest Districts.</p>

<p><i>Forest Products Laboratory Experiments.</i>
The work of the Forest Products Laboratory includes
investigations on the mechanical properties
of wood; the physical and chemical characteristics
and properties of wood; air seasoning and artificial
drying of wood; agencies destructive to wood; wood
preservation; wood distillation; production of naval
stores; and the production of pulp and paper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
other chemical products of wood. This work is
carried on at the Laboratory and sometimes in
coöperation with the National Forests and district
experts. At the Laboratory there is a director
and a large staff of technical and scientific men,
such as chemists, physicists, and engineers, each of
whom is an expert in his particular line of work.</p>

<p>A good deal of attention is given to testing the
strength of woods grown in the United States, as
a means of assisting users to select the species best
adapted to a given purpose, or to find substitutes
for species which are becoming difficult to obtain.
The strength of a good many species used for
structural timbers has been tested. The species
most used for this class of timber are the Southern
pines, Douglas fir, Norway pine, Tamarack, and
Red spruce. An important discovery was made
several years ago that Western hemlock, generally
considered an inferior timber, showed an average
strength 88 per cent. as great as that of Douglas
fir, one of the best construction timbers in the
United States. Strength tests have also been
made on fire-killed timber and these have shown
that timber killed by fire is almost as strong as
green timber. Other tests have been made to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the effect of preservative treatment upon
the strength of timber. As a result of the large
number and variety of strength tests carried on by
this Laboratory the United States Government
now has a more thorough and comprehensive collection
of data on the mechanical properties of
wood than any other nation.</p>

<p>Many studies are also conducted to determine
the physical properties and the structure of the different
kinds of wood grown in this country. The
minute structure of the wood of many of our native
species has been studied by means of microscopic
slides. A study has also been made of a large
number of species to determine the specific gravity
of the actual wood substance. Other tests are
made to determine the specific heat of woods.</p>

<p>The drying or seasoning of woods, more especially
of certain species which have been found
difficult to season, has received a good deal of attention.
A new type of kiln, invented by a Forest
Service man, has been devised to season such woods
as the eucalyptus, which has always been very difficult
to handle in drying. Western larch has been
seasoned with a loss of only 5 per cent., whereas
the loss in ordinary commercial kilns usually ran between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
60 and 70 per cent. As a result, many
manufacturers have remodeled their old kilns to
embody the new Forest Service methods. A new
method has also been developed for the rapid dry-kilning
of Eastern hemlock, which has great commercial
possibilities.</p>

<p>Experiments in wood preservation have to do
with the kind of preservatives it is best to use, the
character of the wood to be treated, and the
methods of injection. Experiments have developed
the best methods for treating railroad ties,
mine timbers, fence posts, wood paving blocks,
telephone and telegraph poles, and wharf piling.
Untreated mine timbers have been found to last
only from 1 to 2 years, while treated ones are
usually entirely sound at the end of 4 years. Untreated
railroad ties last from 5 to 10 years, while
treated ones will last over 15. Such experiments
as these have shown the advisability of
treating all kinds of timbers with creosote or zinc
chloride, or some other preservative. Many new
preservatives are being proposed or marketed each
year by various companies or individuals. These
are all tested to determine their value to prevent
the growth of fungi in the wood. Their efficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
varies greatly and many of them have been shown
to have very small value.</p>

<p>Studies in wood distillation seek to find new
woods which can be used for this industry, new
and more efficient methods which can be employed,
and new uses for wood waste and stumps. Charcoal,
wood alcohol, acetate of lime, and tar are
derived from the distillation of such woods as
beech, birch, and maple, to which tar oils and turpentine
are added for the pines and other resinous
woods. These by-products of wood distillation
have many uses, as well as the many products which
are, in turn, made from these by-products. Charcoal
is used in the manufacture of black powder,
acetic acid is used in the manufacture of explosives,
and wood alcohol is converted into formaldehyde
for disinfection against contagious diseases. By
means of temperature control methods developed at
the Laboratory in the destructive distillation of
hardwoods, the net gain per annum of one company's
plant was over $17,000. About one-half of
the plants of the country have adopted the new
method developed by the Forest Products Laboratory.</p>

<p>Experiments have been conducted by the Laboratory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the distillation of the needles of coniferous
trees and the distillation of the crude gum of some
of the important timber trees of the South and
West. The oils distilled from many trees in this
way have found great use for various purposes.
Shoeblacking owes its peculiar aromatic odor,
faintly suggestive of the deep spruce and hemlock
woods, to an oil which is distilled from these same
kind of needles. Evergreen tree leaf oils are used
for the perfume of soap, and in the manufacture of
liniments, insecticides, and medicinal preparations.</p>

<p>Investigations have been carried on at the Forest
Products Laboratory in making artificial silk from
sawdust. The industry has already attained considerable
proportions. It consists principally of
converting cellulose into viscose, which, in turn, is
manufactured into an almost endless number and
variety of silk and other goods varying from sausage
casings to silk hose and tapestries. Sawdust
is used also in the manufacture of inlaid linoleum
and dynamite.</p>

<p>Experiments in naval stores are attempting to
improve the old methods of harvesting turpentine,
which have proven very destructive to the forests.
With the approaching exhaustion of the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Pinery as a field for the naval stores industry, it
has become more and more important to find other
species for this purpose. Consequently the Laboratory
has conducted experiments with the various
pines on the National Forests in California, Colorado,
Arizona, and New Mexico.</p>

<p>A great many pulp and paper investigations are
also conducted by this Laboratory. The large size
of the industry and the threatened exhaustion of
the native spruce forests which furnish the principal
supply are circumstances which call for intensive
investigations. About nine-tenths of the
paper which we use is made from wood, and the
amount of wood which is converted into paper annually
has reached almost 5,000,000 cords. There
are over 2,500 newspapers in the United States,
and it is said that a single issue of a New York
Sunday paper consumes the trees on about 15 acres
of forest. The main object of the work at the
Laboratory has been to use other species of wood
for the manufacture of paper to offset the fast
waning supplies of spruce. Poplar, hemlock, pine
and balsam are now being used in considerable
quantities. News and wrapping paper has also
been successfully made from many National Forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
species, including Sitka spruce, Western hemlock,
Engelmann spruce, Red fir, White fir, and Lodgepole
pine. Kraft paper has been made and manufactured
into suitcases, bags, wall coverings, twine,
and similar articles. Not only has the Forest
Products Laboratory brought into use species of
trees never before tried for paper making, but it
has also improved some of the old methods of
paper making to such an extent that the results
have been adopted by various large paper mills.</p>

<p>Many strength tests are conducted with packing
boxes. The railroad companies of the United
States are paying annually claims amounting to
many millions of dollars because of goods damaged
in shipment. Much of the damage is preventable
through properly constructed boxes. Tests conducted
at the Laboratory have shown for canned-food
boxes an increase in strength of 300 per cent,
by the use of four additional nails in each end of
the box. The results of these tests are being
rapidly adopted by manufacturers and canners.</p>

<p>The dyeing principle of the Osage orange wood
was not used prior to the investigations conducted
by the Laboratory. The value of this material has
been so conclusively shown that about one million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
dollars' worth of the dye is now being manufactured
annually in the United States and practically
all from material which was formerly wasted.</p>

<p>The discovery that sodium fluoride is superior
to sodium carbonate in preventing sap stain in lumber
promises to reduce materially the present estimated
loss of $7,000,000 from this cause.</p>

<p><i>Industrial Investigations.</i> The function of the
Office of Industrial Investigations of the Branch
of Forest Research is to conduct statistical and industrial
studies of uses of wood in the United
States. The aim of these investigations is to determine
methods and conditions under which wood
is now used; the marketable products obtained from
it; tendencies in methods of manufacture; and improved
methods possible, especially in the utilization
of waste. When practicable, such investigations
are followed by the commercial application
of their results. This office also conducts all statistical
investigations of the production and use of
forest products.</p>

<p>The work of industrial investigations includes
the following: collection and compilation of statistics
on the production and consumption of forest
products, prevailing market and stumpage prices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
imports and exports, and transportation rates; the
compilation and study of specifications of rough
and manufactured forest products; studies of lumber
manufacture and wood-using industries as to
methods, forms of material, waste, costs, equipment,
substitution of one species for another, and
improvements through a more conservative use of
raw material; studies of special problems or features
of wood-using industries; advice and assistance
to States, industries and individuals along
such lines of work; and the dissemination of results
by publications.</p>

<p>Many studies in wood utilization are made not
only of certain industries like the shingle, or the
lumber industry, but also dealing with the industries
of particular sections of the country and with
the various States. These investigations in the
States show the kinds and amounts of woods required
by the various industries, the purposes for
which the various species are employed, and the
extent of their use. So far the wood-using industries
of 35 States have been studied and the results
published.</p>

<p>Records of lumber prices for important woods
are compiled quarterly. These figures are useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in establishing timber sale prices on the National
Forests. Statistics as to the annual consumption
of lumber in the country are also compiled by this
office.</p>

<p>The wood waste exchange was established in
1914 by the Forest Service. It consists of two lists
of manufacturers, which are sent out quarterly to
persons desiring them. One of these is of "Opportunities
to Sell Waste" and contains the names of
firms which use sawdust and small pieces of wood.
This list is sent to people having waste for sale.
The other list is of "Opportunities to Buy Waste,"
and gives the names of concerns which have waste to
dispose of. This list is sent to people who wish to
buy material. No charge is made for this service,
and at the present time over 500 coöperators are
using this exchange.</p>

<p>By the use of this exchange, makers of wooden
novelties have been successful in finding supplies
of material near their plants. Other wood-working
industries have been able to dispose of their
waste at higher prices than they could otherwise
have obtained. Many firms were located within
short distances of each other, but until recently
have had no way of getting together. A Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
firm, engaged in the manufacture of composition
flooring, has been able to obtain a portion of
its sawdust from a New York lumber company. A
New York woodworking establishment disposed of
its waste pieces of white oak and sugar maple to a
maker of wooden novelties in Connecticut for use
in the manufacture of furniture knobs. A clock
maker of Connecticut secured waste material for
making clock boxes from the planing mill of a New
York lumber company.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE PROTECTION OF THE NATIONAL FORESTS</span></h2>

<p>The resources of the National Forests may be
injured or destroyed in many ways. Fire may
burn the timber and young growth; insects and
tree diseases may damage or kill timber, and certain
persons may innocently or willfully commit trespass
on National Forest land and use the resources
without permit. Then also, the fish and game of
the Forests must be protected from unlawful shooting
and trapping, and the water issuing from National
Forest streams must be kept free from pollution,
to protect the public health.</p>

<h3>PROTECTION FROM FIRE</h3>

<p><i>Forest Fire Danger on the National Forests.</i>
Practically all the resources of the National Forests
are subject to severe injury or even to entire destruction
by fire. It is an ever-present danger on
the National Forests, due to their great inaccessibility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
their dry climate, and to other unfavorable
conditions. There are probably few forest regions
in the world where the danger of fire is greater than
on the National Forests. The great size of the
individual Forests, as compared with the size of the
available patrolling force, the difficulty of reaching
remote areas across miles of wilderness, the dry
air and light rainfall in most parts of the western
United States, the prevalence of lightning storms
in the mountains, the sparseness of the population,
and the constant use of fire in the industries and
the daily life of the people, all combine to make the
hazard exceptional.</p>

<p><i>Importance of Fire Protection.</i> Forest fires
when uncontrolled mean the loss of human lives,
the destruction of homes, live stock, forage, timber
and watershed cover. Besides the direct damage
to the National Forest resources it defeats all attempts
to practice forestry; it nullifies all efforts of
forest management, such as regulation of cutting
to insure a second crop of timber, the planting of
denuded areas, and the restriction of grazing to
assist reproduction. Fire destroys the very improvements
which are constructed annually at
great expense. In other words, protection from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
fire is the first and most important problem on the
National Forests without which no operation or
transaction, however small, can be undertaken.</p>

<p>If the problem of fire protection is the most important
task confronting a Forest officer on the National
Forests, then certainly fire prevention is next
in importance. Obviously it is easier to prevent
fires than to fight them. All large conflagrations
have their origin in small fires which if they could
be reached in time could probably be put out
by one man. But in regions remote from water
and supplies fires may start and reach vast proportions
before a party of fire fighters can get to the
scene, no matter how promptly the start is made.
By far the best plan, therefore, is to prevent fires
rather than to depend upon fighting them after
they get started. To this end the Forest Service
has given the most earnest consideration. During
the dangerous season the main attention of Forest
Supervisors and Forest Rangers is devoted to preventing
fire. Extra men are employed, the Forests
are systematically patrolled, and a careful
lookout is maintained from high points. Roads and
trails are so built that every part of the Forests
may be quickly reached with pack animals. Tools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and food for fire fighters are stored at convenient
places. The Ranger stations and lookout houses
are connected with the office of the Forest Supervisor
by telephone, so that men may be quickly
assembled to fight a dangerous fire which the patrolman
cannot subdue alone. Each Forest Supervisor
endeavors to secure the coöperation of all
forest users in the work of preventing fires and in
reporting and helping to fight them in case they get
started.</p>

<p>Probably the beginning point of any discussion
of forest fires is a consideration of their causes.
The Forest Service has kept careful records year
after year (by calendar and not fiscal years) concerning
the cause, the damage, the area burned
over, the cost of fighting and many other matters.
During the calendar year 1917 there were 7,814
forest fires on the National Forests. Of these the
National Forests of California had to contend with
1,862. Of the total number of forest fires 40 per
cent. were confined to less than 1/4 of an acre, 28
per cent. to less than 10 acres, while 32 per cent.
spread over areas greater than 10 acres. The large
percentage of small fires shows how efficiently the
National Forest fire protection organization works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in keeping the area burned over to the lowest possible
acreage.</p>

<p><i>Causes of Forest Fires on the National Forests.</i>
Forest fires on the National Forests originate in
many different ways. In 1917, lightning caused
27 per cent.; unknown agencies, 17 per cent.;
campers, 17 per cent.; incendiaries, 12 per cent.;
railroads, 13 per cent.; brush burning, 7 per cent.;
saw mills, 3 per cent., and all other causes, 4 per
cent. Thus it will be seen that a very large percentage,
at least 60 per cent., of the fires are attributable
to human agencies and are therefore preventable.
At least 27 per cent, of the fires, those
attributed to lightning, are not preventable, and
the only way to combat those is for the Forest officer
to get to them as soon as possible after they get
started. The preventable fires, however, may be
arrested at their source, that is, by popular education
dealing with the use of fire in the woods these
causes can be greatly reduced and, in time, no doubt,
eliminated. Therefore, the fire protection problem
immediately resolves itself into two almost distinct
phases of action&mdash;fire prevention and fire control.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Just how these various agencies start fires may
be of interest. Railroads cause fires by their locomotives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
sending out sparks through the smokestack
or dropping hot ashes along the right-of-way.
These sparks alight in inflammable material, such
as dry grass and leaves, and start a fire. Lightning
sets fire to trees, especially dead and dry ones.
In the California mountains, lightning storms without
rain are frequent and these do great damage.
The author has seen as many as nine forest fires
started by a single lightning storm inside of
half an hour. Incendiary fires are set by people
with varying intent. How many are set with
malicious intent, just to see the forests burn, is not
known, but many fires are started by people setting
fires to drive game, to improve the pasture, to make
traveling through the woods easier, or for other
reasons. Brush burning includes those fires which
start from settlers clearing land and burning the
brush and thickets. Campers cause a large percentage
of the fires by leaving their camp fires
burning. Instead of extinguishing them before
they leave camp, careless people let them burn;
a wind blows a few sparks into some dry leaves or
grass nearby, and the fire is started. Many forest
fires also start around logging camps by sparks escaping
from logging engines, or by setting fire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the slash that is left after logging and allowing
these fires to get beyond control.</p>

<p><i>Behavior of Forest Fires.</i> Fires behave differently,
once they get started, depending upon the
character of the timber, the amount of wind, and
the degree of inflammability of the forest cover.
Ground fires burn the inflammable dry grass,
needles, dead twigs, etc., on the ground; crown fires
are much more severe and, being usually fanned by
a heavy wind, run through the tops or crowns of the
trees; brush fires burn the bushes and dry shrubs
from 5 to 10 feet high; timber fires consume the
entire forest&mdash;crown, stem, ground cover, and undergrowth&mdash;and
usually occur in timber that stands
close together.</p>

<p><i>Losses by Forest Fires on the National Forests.</i>
The results of forest fires naturally vary with the
kind and intensity of the fire. Crown and timber
fires do the most damage, and ground and brush
fires do less. While the ground fires and brush
fires seem to do very little damage to the valuable
timber, still they may greatly reduce the productive
power of the soil and destroy the watershed cover.
Severe ground fires may kill valuable timber by
girdling the trees. The great fires of August, 1910,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
which swept northern Idaho and western Montana
destroyed millions of dollars' worth of timber
and 85 human lives, and cost the United States
$839,000 for fire fighting. These were timber fires
and they occurred for the most part in valuable
stands of dense timber.</p>

<p>The forest fire losses on the National Forests for
the last 9 years show a very great and gradual
reduction of losses due to forest fires. In 1908, the
total loss through fires was $451,188 and in 1909
it was $297,275. In 1910, the year of the great
fires in Montana and Idaho, there were very heavy
losses in timber and human lives, due to an unusual
combination of dry weather and high winds. But
in that year the fire organization was not complete;
it had never really been tried out. In this year the
organization received its first severe test, and while
it did the best it could with the available men and
equipment, the situation in Idaho pointed out conclusively
the weak points and the short-comings.
The proof of these statements is found in the statistics
of the next 5 years, when the average total loss
for 1911 to 1915, inclusive, was $293,000, and, it
must be remembered, several of these years were
equally as unfavorable, so far as dry weather and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
high winds were concerned, as the year 1910. During
these years, however, the fire fighting organization
had a good chance to be tried out thoroughly;
for, as is quite evident, experience is the
greatest teacher in this kind of work. During the
calendar year 1916 the fire losses reached a new low
level, compared to other years, the losses amounting
to only $198,599. In 1917 they were higher.</p>

<p><i>The Forest Fire Problem Stated.</i> Having seen
a little of the causes, behavior and results of forest
fires on the National Forests, it is comparatively
easy to state the forest fire problem as it occurs on
the National Forests. Briefly stated, it is this:
With the funds, organization and equipment that
are available, the aim of the Forest Service is to
keep the area burned over each year (and therefore
the damage done) down to an accepted reasonable
minimum. But the problem is not as easily worked
out as it is stated, due, largely, to a great many
uncontrollable and variable factors which cannot be
foreseen in advance, the most important of which
are the weather conditions. As has been said before,
there are two general ways of keeping the
area burned over down to an accepted reasonable
minimum: either prevent the fires from getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
started (as in the case of those started by human
agencies) or, after they get started, to get to them
with men and fire fighting implements in the shortest
possible time after they are found. The former
is called fire prevention, and the latter fire suppression
or control. How the organization of the National
Forests solves these two problems is of the
greatest interest.</p>

<p><i>Fire Prevention.</i> The measures employed for
fire prevention may be either administrative, legislative
or educative in nature.</p>

<p>The most important administrative measures employed
to prevent fire are those that aim to reduce
the amount of inflammable material in the National
Forests. This is done in many different
ways. The free use timber policy enables Rangers
to give away much dead timber, both standing and
down. Timber operators cutting on the National
Forests are required by the Forest Service contract
to remove dead snags, which are a fire menace, from
the timber sale area. Where there is fire danger,
all slashing resulting from such sales must be
burned or otherwise disposed of. While grazing
is usually not considered a measure to prevent fires,
still grass lands that have not been grazed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
become very dry in the fall and are a dangerous
fire menace. Wherever it is feasible, old slash left
by lumbermen on private lands adjacent or near to
the National Forests are burned, when the fire can
be confined to a small area. Another administrative
measure is the reduction of the causes of fires
by a patrol force. Forest Guards travel along the
highways where there is most traffic and most danger.
Their presence often is enough to remind
campers, hunters and fishermen to put their camp
fires out before leaving them. These patrolmen
mix with the people and, if necessary, remind them
in a courteous way to be careful to extinguish their
camp fires before breaking camp.</p>

<p>Most of the necessary legislative measures for
preventing forest fires already exist. The National
Forest force is seeking merely to obtain a
strict enforcement of existing laws. Railroads are
required to use spark-arresters on their locomotives
and to provide for keeping their rights-of-way free
from inflammable material. Logging camps must
also prevent the destruction of National Forest
timber by fire by using spark-arresters on all logging
engines. The Forest officers are ever on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the alert for the detection and apprehension of
campers for leaving fires unextinguished and incendiaries
for starting fires willfully. These careless
individuals are arrested by them without warrant,
either under the Federal laws, if the fire occurred
on National Forest lands, or under the State
law, if it occurred outside of government lands.</p>

<p>Educational measures are for the purpose of educating
both the local forest-using public and the
general public who may travel through the Forests
in the careful use of fires in the forests. Forest
officers, especially Rangers, come into personal
touch with local residents and users, that is, the
ranchers, stockmen, business men, loggers, campers,
hunters, fishermen and others. Such people are
often reminded by personal appeals by the Forest
officers. Most of them have learned by this time,
because of having been called upon to help fight
fires at one time or another, and having gotten a
taste of the result of other people's carelessness.
Many written appeals are also sent out by the Supervisor
and are slipped into the envelopes when
grazing permits and other official documents are
mailed. One of these written appeals, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the one that has been used most widely, is
known as the six rules for the prevention of fires
in the mountains:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang2">1.&nbsp;Matches.&mdash;Be sure your match is out. Break it in two before
you throw it away.</p>

<p class="hang2">2.&nbsp;Tobacco.&mdash;Throw pipe ashes and cigar or cigarette stumps
in the dust of the road and stamp or pinch out the fire
before leaving them. Don't throw them into the brush,
leaves, or needles.</p>

<p class="hang2">3.&nbsp;Making camp.&mdash;Build a small camp fire. Build it in the
open, not against a tree or log, or near brush. Scrape
away the trash from all around it.</p>

<p class="hang2">4.&nbsp;Leaving camp.&mdash;Never leave a camp fire, even for a short
time, without quenching it with water or earth.</p>

<p class="hang2">5.&nbsp;Bonfires.&mdash;Never build bonfires in windy weather or where
there is the slightest danger of their escaping from control.
Don't make them larger than you need.</p>

<p class="hang2">6.&nbsp;Fighting fires.&mdash;If you find a fire try to put it out. If you
can't, get word of it to the nearest United States forest
ranger or State fire warden at once. Keep in touch with
the rangers.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Besides these kinds of appeals, many kinds of
fire warnings are posted at conspicuous places along
roads and trails to remind the public to be careful
with fire in the Forests.</p>

<p>An attempt is also made to reach the general public,
that is, those living outside the local communities,
but who occasionally travel through and use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the National Forests. Many hundreds of thousands
travel through the Forests every year by automobile
or by other conveyances. These people
camp in the Forests, fish, hunt, and enjoy the cool
climate and beautiful scenery. Before they start
on their trips, that is, while they are still in their
home towns, and also while they are on their way,
many means have been devised to reach them.
They are confronted with newspaper advertisements,
folders, booklets, and other printed matter.
In towns and cities, public meetings, lectures, exhibits,
expositions, county fairs, commercial clubs,
and the chambers of commerce, all help, either directly
or indirectly, by one means or another, to inform
the people of the great fire danger on the
National Forests. Even the letters sent out by the
District Forester and the Supervisors have written
appeals affixed to the outside of the envelopes by
means of a rubber stamp. In short, every possible
means is used to educate the public that uses the National
Forests and in whose interest, in fact, the
Forests are being maintained and protected.</p>

<p><i>Fire Suppression.</i> So much for the problem of
fire prevention. In case a fire does get started, and
there are thousands of them on the National Forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
every year, the problem, as has been said before,
consists of getting men and tools to it in the shortest
possible time, in order to keep the damage down to
the lowest possible point. To do this, a vast organization
has been formed by the Forest Service,
which is not unlike the Minute Man organization
of Revolutionary days. A brief outline of this organization
and how it works when a fire starts will
give my reader a still better idea of what the Forest
Service is doing in forest fire protection. But before
speaking of this organization, a few preliminary
matters are of interest; they deal with the
manner of distributing fire protection funds, forest
fire history, and the study of weather conditions.</p>

<p><i>How Forest Fire Funds Are Distributed.</i> It
devolves upon the Forest Supervisor and also the
District Forester to apportion the appropriation
allotted for fire protection in the most economical
and efficient manner. First of all, the money is
allotted to the various Forests in proportion to their
needs. These needs are measured by the size of the
Forest, the value of its resources, the length of the
dangerous dry season, the fire liability or the
amount of money loss in case of fire, the fire hazard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
or the degree to which an area is subject to fire
danger, the difficulty of prevention and control and
many other factors. These same factors are employed
to apportion the Supervisor's allotment of
money to the various Ranger districts on his Forest.</p>

<p>Probably the most difficult factors for the Forest
Supervisor to appraise on each Ranger district are
the fire liability and the fire hazard. Fire liability
has to do with the amount of damage a fire could
do if it got started. Valuable timber needs protection
most of all, and the value of the forest is
determined by the kind of trees in it and the density
of the stand. Fire hazard is usually expressed
in terms of risk. The Supervisor asks his Ranger if
the risk on a certain area in his district is high, low,
or medium. Risk depends, of course, largely upon
the character and inflammability of the forest cover
and the presence of human causes. Dense forests
involve greater risk than open, scattering trees;
government forests interspersed with private holdings
containing much old slash have a high risk
factor; and government forests near sawmills, large
towns, and along railroad rights-of-way also have
high risk factors. All these matters must be considered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in order that each area on each Ranger district
gets just enough money for fire protection and not
a bit more.</p>

<p><i>Forest Fire History.</i> Very important also in fire
protection are the studies which the Forest Service
is carrying on, dealing with forest fire history.
For many years back, records have been kept on all
fires: their causes, area burned over, date of the fire,
damage caused, the exact location of each fire, the
cost of fighting it, the total number each month and
each calendar year, and many other data. More
recently records have been kept upon still further
details connected with each fire, such as: the time
elapsed between the start and the discovery of a fire,
between the discovery and the report to the proper
official, between the report and the beginning of the
actual work of fighting, and the time required to
put the fire out. Intensive studies have been made
also upon the length and character of the fire season
on each Forest, for it is important to know the
maximum length, the minimum length and the
average length of the fire season. These data show
how much extra help must be hired for fire patrol
and fire fighting, and during what periods the
greatest damage is done, based both on acreage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
burned over and by the number of fires. Studies
of this kind yield positive information on what areas
of each Forest are particularly liable to lightning
fires, to camp fires, and to incendiary fires. With
this knowledge the Forest Supervisor can plan and
distribute his men and funds more intelligently;
they tell him during what period he can expect the
most trouble, and therefore must have the greatest
number of fire fighters at his command. It is
scientific study like this that is doing more than
anything else to solve the fire protection problem
in the Western States.</p>

<p><i>Relation of Forest Fires to the Weather.</i> In
coöperation with the United States Weather
Bureau, the Forest Service studies weather conditions
in relation to forest fires. Weather forecasts
have been sent to each Forest Supervisor throughout
the fire season, informing him of the probable
weather conditions. The velocity and duration of
the wind, the temperature, the precipitation, and
the relative humidity are all factors which greatly
affect the inflammability of the forest. Forest Supervisors
have been informed in these forecasts of
what are known as emergency conditions, that is,
an unusual and abnormal combination of weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
conditions which make fire danger very great.
These conditions may be a high wind, low relative
humidity, high temperatures, or a combination of
the three. When a Forest Supervisor is informed
by the District Forester that emergency conditions
are likely to exist during the next ten days or so, he
immediately sends an alarm to all his Rangers to be
especially watchful.</p>

<p><i>Improvements and Equipment for Protection.</i>
After the preliminaries of fire protection finance,
forest fire history, and the study of weather and
emergency conditions have been worked out, probably
the first and most important prerequisite to
forest fire protection is a matter already spoken of,
namely, the improvements and the equipment.
The construction and maintenance of improvements
and the possession of suitable equipment is second
in importance only to the organization which is to
do the actual fire suppression. Roads, trails, telephone
lines, fire lines, lookout stations, Ranger stations,
tool and food caches, a central supply depot,
and many other things are necessary before men
can be effective. Each Forest Ranger has use for
the following equipment: fire fighting tools, water
bags and pails, teams, pack horses, wagons, automobiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
saddle horses, tents, portable telephone
lines, riding and packing equipment, and many
other special equipment, which must be hired when
occasion for its use arises. If a Forest Ranger
has not access to this equipment, and few of them
have, he has hanging by his telephone a complete list
of all the stores, stables, garages, etc., in the neighboring
towns and how much equipment each can
furnish when called upon.</p>

<p><i>Forest Fire Maps and Charts.</i> Not the least
important bit of equipment, by any means, is the
fire map or maps. The Forest Supervisor has a
fire map of his whole forest in his office and the
Forest Ranger has one of his district (sometimes
including the neighboring districts, too) hanging
in his cabin, usually posted conspicuously, so that
it can be referred to any time of the day or night
without delay. These maps have upon them all
the available information regarding the country
which is to be protected. They show physiographic
features, such as topography, creeks, springs,
meadows, water, swamps, etc.; vegetative features,
such as timber, forage, brush, reproduction, planted
areas, regenerating areas, slashings, etc.; such man-made
features as roads, trails, cabins, ranger stations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
corrals, pastures, Supervisor's headquarters,
sheep camps, cattle camps, ranches, camp sites, railroads,
logging railroads and camps, sawmills,
power plants, towns, villages, etc.; and special protective
features, such as locations of men, tools,
equipment, tool and food caches, local help, emergency
help, fire lines, fire breaks, lookouts, government
and private telephone lines, instruments and
switchboards, locations of stores, state Fire Wardens,
livery stables, pack trains, garages, stage
routes, etc. All these features and data are not put
upon one map; usually a series of maps are used or
some of the information is put on charts or on the
border of the maps. In short all this information is
put in such form that it is available at the shortest
notice for emergency conditions. It makes little
difference how it is recorded, so long as the information
is available when needed.</p>

<p><i>Forest Fire Organization.</i> The forest fire organization,
whether it be on the whole National
Forest or upon the Ranger district, consists of three
agencies: the fire detection agencies, the fire reporting
agencies, and the fire fighting agencies. All
these must work in absolute harmony without interruption
of any kind, to obtain the maximum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
efficiency. The detection agencies consist of the
lookout men, stationed at high, advantageous
points which overlook large areas, and the moving
patrolmen, who are assigned to definite beats or territory
which cannot be adequately reached by the
lookouts. Lookout men live in small cabins on the
tops of high mountains, and they watch for fires
constantly. In regions which have very few high
points and which are not suited to that method
of detection, moving patrolmen are employed.
These men move about on foot, on horseback, on
railroad speeders, in automobiles, or in any other
conveyance adapted to the country they are in.</p>

<p>When the detectors find a fire they report it immediately
to the nearest Forest Ranger or the Forest
Supervisor. The Forest Ranger in whose district
the fire is located is logically the first man to be
informed, but telephone connections and other conditions
sometimes alter this procedure. Just because
a fire is found in, we will say, Ranger district
number one, does not necessarily mean that the
Forest Ranger of this district is the proper man
to be notified. The fire may be at the very outer
boundary of his district and may be much more
easily accessible to the Forest Ranger in district<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
number two. In any case it is all arranged beforehand
just exactly who shall be notified in case of a
fire in each and every corner of a National Forest.
Each man in the organization has his duties and responsibilities
determined for him in advance and he
does his part without being prodded or reminded.
The location of a fire in the wild and inaccessible
forest regions of the West, which may seem a very
simple matter, is determined in a very ingenious
manner.</p>

<p><i>How Fires Are Located.</i> The lookout man, as
well as the Forest Rangers and the Forest Supervisor,
is provided with identical maps of the Forest.
These maps show most of the important features
useful in fire protection work, including also
the private lands, all government holdings, and the
public land survey. This public land survey has
divided the land surface into legal subdivisions
known as townships, sections, and quarter sections,
and it is by these and with reference to these that
all features, both natural and artificial, are located.
A township is usually a square 6 miles on a side,
containing 36 sections. Each section is divided into
quarter sections containing 160 acres each, which
are further divided (though not by law) into forty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>acre
squares. The problem, therefore, that confronts
the lookout man upon the discovery of a
forest fire is to inform the Ranger or other Forest
officer where the fire is&mdash;that is, in what <i>section</i> it is
located, if it cannot be located with reference to
some well-known natural feature.</p>

<p>In order to determine in what section or quarter
section a fire is located, each lookout point on the
Supervisor's and Rangers' fire maps has a transparent
circular protractor mounted on it. (A protractor
is a device by which angles are marked off;
it consists of a circle upon whose arc the degrees
from 0 to 360 are indicated, 0 degrees being equivalent
to North, 90° to East, 180° to South and 270°
to West.) The center of the protractor is the
lookout point. A piece of black thread is fastened
to the center of each lookout point, so that it can be
stretched across the arc of the circle and the degrees
read off. The other end of the thread has
fastened to it a thumb tack or similar device, so that
when the thread is stretched to read a certain angle,
it can be fixed at that angle. The maps of the
lookout men are usually fastened or permanently
mounted upon a table which is oriented (that is, the
top of the map is turned toward the north). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
lookout men have sighting devices, usually alidades,
which are placed on the map, by means of
which they sight at a fire; but the bearing of the
fire is read from the angles marked on the edge of
the map, which is in reality a large protractor.</p>

<p>By these devices a fire is quickly and accurately
located. When the lookout man sees a fire, he gets
its bearing from the map by means of the sighting
device. He telephones this bearing to the Ranger,
or, in many cases, to the Supervisor. Immediately
the Supervisor goes to his map, picks up
the black thread attached to this lookout point,
stretches the string, and, having marked off the
bearing, pushes the thumb tack into the map. In
the meantime, another lookout, perhaps two more,
have sighted the same fire. The black threads from
the other lookout points on the Supervisor's map
are stretched and fixed in a similar manner. The
fire will be found to be at the point where two or
more of these black threads intersect. This is only
one of the many ways which have been devised to
locate forest fires; there are other methods, but all
are based upon the same principle.</p>

<p><i>The Fire Fighting Organization.</i> The organization
of men who do the actual fire suppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
must be an elastic one, adequate to meet the needs
of a Ranger district or of a whole National Forest,
or, in some cases, of an entire administrative district,
comprising as many as 25 to 30 National
Forests. The Forest Guards and Forest Rangers
are known as the first line of defense in this war
against forest fires. Upon them falls the brunt of
the work of fire suppression. The second line is
composed of local stockmen, ranchers, and logging
and sawmill crews. When these prove insufficient
in number, the large villages and towns are called
upon, and the last resort is the labor of the cities
and the United States Army. Thus, in the case of
a very large fire the organization of the Forest
Service is modified to cover not only each and every
National Forest, but also entire States. In case of
a very large fire, every available man from each
Forest is sent to take his place in the organization.
Expert fire fighters are sent direct to the fire.
Other Forest officers are sent to the large towns and
villages to act as quartermasters. These men hire
fire fighters, entrain them, and fill orders for food,
bedding, tools, and other equipment. Other quartermasters
at the scene of the fire check shipments
of supplies, check the time of fire fighters, approve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
accounts, hire transportation, and perform similar
duties. Special disbursing agents are sent to the
scene to pay the men. In short, everything is done
to dispatch as quickly as possible the necessary men,
food and equipment to the fire, and to do it in
accordance with the prearranged plan for such
emergencies.</p>

<p><i>Forest Fire Coöperation.</i> A very important
part of the plan of fire protection on the National
Forests are the coöperative agreements entered into
between the Forest Service and private individuals
or companies. Such coöperation may be in the
form of building improvements for fire suppression,
furnishing men in case of fire, furnishing lookouts
or patrols, furnishing equipment, and, in fact, in
connection with any of the necessary means for
fighting fire. This coöperation has been of mutual
benefit. One National Forest may coöperate
with one or more neighboring Forests or with
sawmills, power plants, logging camps, or railroad
companies. Coöperation may also be with a well-organized
Forest Protection Association, of which
there are a large number in the Western States.
These coöperative agencies agree to send a large
force of their men to fires on the National Forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in their vicinity, and the Forest Service reciprocates
by sending men for fires occurring on their lands,
which may threaten National Forest timber.
Often coöperative agencies enter into agreement
to build jointly with the Forest Service certain
improvements, such as telephone lines, lookout
towers, or trails, which will benefit public fire protection
as well as private. Many sawmills and logging
companies who operate on or near the National
Forests have agreements with the Service,
by which they suspend all operations and send all
their help to fires which threaten National Forest
timber. All timber sale contracts of the Forest
Service provide for coöperative fire protection.</p>

<p><i>Fighting Forest Fires.</i> The most important requirements
for successful fire suppression are:
quick arrival after discovery, adequate forces of
men, proper equipment, thorough organization on
the fire line, skill in attacking, and careful, systematic
patrol after the fire is thought to be out.
All fires, whether large or small, require generals
to lead the attacking forces, and the strategy of
fire fighting can only be learned after long experience
on the fire line. A cool, level-headed man is
the greatest necessity in an emergency, for it is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
disastrous to get too many men as it is too few. A
few men that know how to attack a fire are worth
a great deal more than a great many that are inexperienced.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There are different kinds of fires, depending
upon their size, their intensity, and the nature of the
country in which they are burning. And there are
as many different methods of fighting fire as there
are kinds of fires. Some fires, such as grass fires or
those burning in the needles and litter in the forest,
can be extinguished directly by being smothered or
beaten out. For this purpose Rangers sometimes
use their saddle blankets, when nothing else is
handy, but usually wet gunny sacks, boughs, and
tree branches are used. Often, if it is available,
sand or dirt is thrown on the fire with a shovel.
Surface fires are a little more difficult to extinguish.
They are more intense and more swift and consume
brush, young growth, and fallen dry trees. These
usually cannot be attacked directly, but must be
controlled indirectly by the building of a trench
or a fire break, or by a system of back firing.
Trenches are fire breaks in miniature, usually from
one to several feet wide. Fire breaks or fire lines
are broad belts from 30 to 50 feet wide, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
cleared of inflammable material, not so much to stop
the fire when it reaches this belt as to furnish a
safe area from which fire can be fought and, most
of all, from which back firing can be started. These
lines or belts are usually built along ridges. If a
fire starts on the lower slope of a mountain and the
wind carries it up the mountain toward the fire line,
the only hope of stopping the fire at the top of the
ridge at the fire line is to start fires on the top of
the ridge, which will burn down the slope and meet
the original fire coming up. In rare cases, as, for
instance, in the Idaho fires of 1910, the fires get to
be so large and swift that all methods of attack
prove futile and the only salvation is in natural
barriers, such as rivers, or a change of the wind, or
rain, to extinguish them.</p>

<p>In all fire fighting work, the plan is to surround
the fire (if it cannot be beaten or smothered out) by
a trench, fire line, or fire break, and to prevent the
fire from spreading. In this kind of work, shovels,
spades, mattocks, rakes, and hoes are used to move
the soil; saws and axes are used to remove fallen
trees from the fire line, and in some cases plows,
dynamite, and other implements are employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h3>PROTECTION AGAINST TRESPASS, FOREST INSECTS, EROSION AND OTHER AGENCIES</h3>

<p>While the protection of the Forest resources from
fire is probably the most important phase of forest
protection, it is not the only one by any means.
The National Forest force also protects the Forest
resources from trespass, from insect damages, and
from tree diseases. Also water supply for domestic
use, for irrigation, water-power, and navigation
must be protected, and the public health must be
safeguarded against the pollution of the streams
emerging from the Forests. It is also the duty of
Forest officers, in coöperation with the state authorities,
to protect game, fish, and birds from illegal
practices.</p>

<p><i>Trespass.</i> The Act of June 4, 1897, authorizes
the Secretary of Agriculture to make rules and
regulations for the occupancy, use and protection of
the National Forests, and provides that any violation
of such rules and regulations shall be punishable
by a fine or imprisonment or both. This and
later acts provide for fines or imprisonment for all
violations of the regulations governing National
Forests. The violation of these regulations constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
trespass, and these may be either fire, timber,
grazing, occupancy or property trespass, depending
upon the offense. Since the United States has all
the civil rights and remedies for trespass possessed
by private individuals, it may bring action to recover
damages resulting from trespass or breach
of contract.</p>

<p>Fire trespass includes the following offenses: setting
fire to timber, brush or grass; building camp
fires in dangerous places where they are hard to
extinguish; or leaving camp fires without completely
extinguishing them. The various railroads
that cross the National Forests are one of the
most frequent offenders in that the sparks issuing
from the locomotives or the hot ashes dropping from
the fire box set fire to National Forest timber. The
railroads are required to use every precaution to
prevent such fires, but many of them are started, resulting
in damage suits by the Government. The
damages cover not only the merchantable timber
and forage destroyed, but damages are also collected
for young, immature growth, which at first
thought might seem to have little or no value. But
the courts have held that while the young, unmerchantable
trees have very little value now, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
have a great value as the basis for a future crop of
timber. Thus, in the case of the United States
versus the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad,
in 1910, for fire trespass on the Black Hills
National Forest, caused by sparks from the locomotives
operated by the company, the damages included
$17,900 for young growth. Also, in the
case of the United States versus the Great Northern
Railroad, in 1911, in which suit was brought
upon the negligence (causing fires to start) of the
defendant company on their right-of-way, which
fires subsequently spread to the Blackfeet National
Forest, damages included the destruction of a great
many immature trees, the value of which was estimated
on the basis of their value at maturity discounted
to date. It is significant that this case
never went to trial; the defendant paid damages
and costs without argument.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">

<div class="caption">Figure 46. A few years ago this was a green, luxuriant forest. Picture taken after the
great fires of August 20, 1910, on the Coeur d'Alene National Forest near Wallace, Idaho
</div></div>

<p>Under timber trespass are included the following
acts: the cutting, killing, girdling, or otherwise
damaging trees; the cutting of timber under sale
contract or permit before it is marked by a Forest
officer; the removal of timber before it is scaled,
measured, or counted by a Forest officer; and the
fraudulent stamping of any timber belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
United States with the regulation marking tools or
similar device. Under grazing trespass are included
such acts as: grazing stock on National Forest
lands without permit; grazing stock on areas
which are designated as closed to grazing; driving
stock across a National Forest without permit; and
refusal to remove stock upon instructions from an
authorized Forest officer when an injury is being
done to the National Forests by reason of the improper
handling of the stock. The use of National
Forest land without a permit for any purpose for
which special use permits are required constitutes
occupancy trespass. But traveling, temporary
camping, hunting, surveying, or prospecting may
be carried on without permit, and camp wood and
forage for stock used in connection with such activities
may be taken free of charge. The unauthorized
appropriation, damage, or destruction of
property belonging to the United States, which is
used in the administration of the National Forests,
also constitutes trespass.</p>

<p>Innocent trespass is usually settled amicably between
the trespasser and the Supervisor. If the
violation of the timber, grazing, or land regulations
was due to a misunderstanding and was not of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
willful character, a permit is issued and the trespasser
pays for the timber or special use, as under
regulation. Fire and property trespass cases seldom
can be construed as innocent, hence in most
cases such offenses result in litigation.</p>

<p><i>Forest Insects.</i> Protection against forest insects
is carried out in coöperation with the Bureau
of Entomology of the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>An essential part of good forest protection is the
work of locating and reporting evidences of insect
depredations. There are scores of insects which
are constantly working in the forests, either injuring
or killing live trees or attacking the wood of
trees after they have been killed. Weevils kill
young shoots on trees and destroy tree seeds; bark
beetles and timber beetles infest the bark, girdle the
tree and destroy the wood; and various borers and
timber worms attack seasoned and unseasoned forest
products and destroy the wood in the forest after
it has been cut down and sawed into lumber. The
greatest annual loss by insects is caused not so
much by conspicuous local outbreaks as in the sustained
annual loss of scattered merchantable trees.
Local infestations often kill a large percentage of
trees on an area, but these outbreaks are easily seen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the scattered infestations that kill a tree or two here
and there over large forest areas are not so noticeable,
but, taken all together, add up to a startling
total.</p>

<p>The task of locating and reporting insect infestations
falls upon the Forest Ranger and other field
men of the Forest Service. Since the Rangers are
practically the only class of Forest officers that
visit all parts of a National Forest during each
field season, the Supervisor relies mostly on them to
report upon insect infestations. In riding to and
from his work, while on fire patrol, while going for
mail and supplies, while attending to the timber,
grazing and other business of his district, the Ranger
does a good deal of traveling and covers practically
every part of his district. These are good opportunities
to watch for fresh outbreaks of insects,
and the wide-awake, progressive Ranger never
misses such chances. If he sees reddish-brown
masses of pitch and sawdust on the bark of a tree he
immediately recognizes it as the work of insects. Or
perhaps he may see a pine or a spruce tree with all
its needles turned yellow. He knows then that this
tree was girdled by bark beetles very recently, probably
during the previous summer. A tree whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
needles had turned red would indicate to him that
the infestation was more than a year old, since
trees attacked in the spring of one year usually do
not show the results until the following summer.
These two stages are known by the trained entomologist
as the "yellow-top" and the "red-top"
stages respectively. The latter is followed by the
"black-top" stage. In this stage, insect infested
trees stand out very conspicuously as leafless, gray
or black snags, and they tell the story of the work
of bark beetles that happened years ago.</p>

<p>Probably the first external evidence of the attack
of a bark beetle upon living trees with normal green
foliage, is the presence of pitch tubes upon the
outer bark. These are small, reddish-brown (later
becoming grayish-white) masses of pitch and sawdust,
which exude from the small cylindrical entrance
made by the adult beetle where it bores
through the bark to begin its egg tunnel. Each
tube represents the entrance of one or more of these
beetles. But we must follow these egg tunnels further,
to learn how the actual damage is done to the
tree. As soon as the bark beetle has made its
entrance through the bark, it starts to work up
through the live bark and cambium of the tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
forming a tunnel but little larger than the diameter
of the beetle, which is known as the egg gallery,
These egg galleries vary in shape from straight to
winding, and in length from ten to forty inches.
As a rule, male and female beetles work together in
one gallery, and the eggs are deposited along the
sides of the gallery, often in little pockets. When
the tunneling and egg-laying process of the adult
beetles is completed, their activity ceases, and they
are usually found dead at the upper end of their
galleries. The larvæ hatch and begin their work
by burrowing across the cambium at right angles to
the egg galleries. The complete girdling of the
cambium layer is not accomplished until the larvæ
have completed their work, and the numerous larval
galleries, by joining one another, form a complete
gallery around the cambium of the tree, thus cutting
off the food supply which is made in the leaves
of the tree, from the lower portion of the tree,
namely the roots. Since the roots cannot live without
nourishment, the tree dies. As soon as the
larvæ have completed their development they pupate.
Later they develop into adult beetles.
These adult beetles issue forth in swarms the following
spring, to attack new trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
The control of insect pests is a difficult matter.
On areas where insect depredations are conspicuous
and are liable to spread to nearby valuable timber,
control measures are undertaken in coöperation
with experts from the Bureau of Entomology. In
these control projects, crews of men fell the infested
trees, strip the bark from them, and burn the bark
(usually at a time of the year when the young
broods of beetles are still in the bark, namely, fall
or winter). Trap trees are sometimes resorted to.
In this method, trees are girdled with an ax and
thereby weakened to such a degree that beetles are
attracted to it. After such a tree has become thoroughly
infested in this manner, it is cut down and
burned. In the case of a large, conspicuous infestation,
an insect reconnoissance is made, in order to
obtain an estimate of the percentage of trees that
have been killed by insects. When it is possible,
the timber is immediately sold. For example, on
the Lassen National Forest, the writer several years
ago made such an estimate of an infestation caused
by the mountain pine beetle, covering over 100,000
acres. The reconnoissance showed that about 35
per cent. of the trees above 12 inches in diameter
had been killed. The killed timber was subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
utilized for telephone and telegraph poles.</p>

<p>There are many administrative measures which
are practiced on the National Forests, which aim to
prevent insect infestation. The prevention and
suppression of forest fires, which form infection
courts for insects, is probably the most important
one. In all timber sales, old dead snags and slashing,
which are breeding places for insects, are disposed
of. Through free use and timber sales, insect-killed
timber is disposed of and the loss due
to insects is reduced to a minimum, besides in many
cases destroying the young insect broods.</p>

<p><i>Tree Diseases.</i> In almost every administrative
district there is a Consulting Pathologist, connected
with the Bureau of Plant Pathology of the Department
of Agriculture, who has charge of all work
dealing with the eradication of tree diseases.</p>

<p>A tree disease is really any condition that interferes
with the normal functioning of the tree, be this
condition caused by fungi, mistletoe, fumes, smoke,
frost, sunscald, drought or excess of water in the
soil. Parasitic fungi and mistletoes cause most of
the tree diseases. Leaf diseases, by killing a
greater part of the foliage, destroy the very organs
in which food for the growing tissues is prepared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Diseases of the bark intercept the flow of food coming
down in the bark from the leaves. Diseases of
the sapwood cut off the water supply, which is
pumped upward from the roots. Those that attack
the roots also affect the water supply of the tree.
Diseases of flowers and seeds destroy the faculty
of reproduction.</p>

<p>Certain parasites are able to enter the youngest
parts of trees, twigs and leaves directly, but the
majority of the fungi causing decay of the wood
can get into the interior of the living tree only by
way of a pin knot or wound. For this reason,
every wound caused by lightning, by fire, by man,
or by animals, constitutes a menace to infection.
Many coniferous trees cover their wounds by an
aseptic coat of pitch, which is very effective in
preventing the germination and growth of fungus
spores. But the less resinous conifers and the
hardwood trees do not cover their wounds very effectively;
large wounds are not covered at all.
Upon exposure by a wound, the sapwood just underneath
the bark dies, dries out, and checks.
Spores of parasitic fungi enter the cracks, germinate
and infect the heartwood. The spores of a
heartwood-inhabiting fungus cannot germinate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
thrive unless they fall upon the heartwood of the
tree. In this way certain diseases of the heartwood,
which result in rot or decay, can very frequently
be traced directly to fire scars, lightning scars, spike
tops, broken limbs or branches, and other mechanical
destruction caused by lightning, fire, storms,
cloudbursts, or heavy snowfall.</p>

<p>Fire as a cause of wounds is responsible for
more cases of heartrot than all other injuries taken
together. For this reason the protection of forests
from fire is the most important preventive measure
that can be taken to eradicate tree diseases. In
fact, the best way of controlling diseases is by preventing
them, and the Forest officers are endeavoring
to eliminate any danger to the health of the
forest, to prevent the injury of the trees, and to
establish healthy conditions for their growth. This
is forest hygiene, and it bears the same relation to
the trees and forests as personal hygiene and community
sanitation do to persons and communities.</p>

<p>It is impossible to grow a sound and thrifty forest
for future generations if there are unhealthful conditions
in the forest that are a constant menace to
the trees. The first step in this hygienic work is
close observation on the part of the Forest officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
The next important step is to prevent the infection
and infestation of sound trees by getting rid of all
diseased and insect-infested living and dying trees.
By means of timber sales and free use, Forest officers
very materially help in establishing healthy conditions
on the National Forests. There is a clause
in most timber sale contracts which requires the cutting
by the purchaser of all snags and other unhealthy
trees on the area. This measure not only
eliminates undesirable trees from a hygienic standpoint,
but it also makes it possible to utilize the
merchantable timber left in undesirable trees, which
would otherwise go to waste. On timber sales, Forest
officers who do the marking leave for reproduction
only such trees as are perfectly sound and
healthy. Mistletoe infested trees, especially, are
marked for cutting, for neither in plant nor in animal
life can healthy offspring be expected to develop
under unhealthful conditions.</p>

<p><i>Water Supply.</i> Undoubtedly the greatest value
of the mountain forests of the West, most of which
are within the National Forests, lies in their influence
upon the regularity of the water supply. In
many States these mountains afford the only water
supply for domestic use, for irrigation, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
development of power. The future development
of the entire region depends, therefore, upon a regular
water supply. It is not so much the amount
of water as the manner in which it flows from the
mountains that is important. To insure this regularity,
the vegetative covering is an important factor.
For this reason, Congress made the preservation
of conditions favorable to stream flow one of
the principal objects in the establishment and administration
of the National Forests.</p>

<p>Many of my readers who have lived out-of-doors
a great deal have learned by common observation
the simple problem of how the forest regulates
stream flow. Any one who has been in a treeless
region after a heavy rainstorm can recall how suddenly
the streams swell and flood their banks, and
how soon these same streams return to their former
flow. On the other hand, a severe rainstorm in a
forested region will hardly have an appreciable
effect upon the streams. The difference is not very
hard to explain. In a treeless region there are no
natural obstacles which might delay or prevent the
raindrops from reaching the ground. The soil is
usually hard and dry, and the water runs off as
though from a gable roof. In a forest, we well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
know, the crowns of the trees intercept most of the
rain that falls; very little strikes the ground directly.
The rain that strikes the crown is dissipated
on the leaves or needles, on the twigs and
branches, and on the trunk. It must travel a long
way before it reaches the ground, and all this delay
helps in preventing a rapid run-off or flood. The
soil in the forest is covered by a living ground cover
of flowers, shrubs and young trees, and by a dead
cover composed of leaves, twigs, dead branches,
fallen trees, all of which interrupt the raindrop's
journey to the ground. Even after the rain
reaches the ground, only a small part of it goes off
as surface run-off. The soil in the forest is loose
and full of holes and channels made by decaying
roots, earth worms, etc., so that the water is absorbed
as fast as it reaches the soil. Also the soil
in the forest contains a large amount of organic
matter, resulting from decaying leaves and
branches, and this organic matter acts as a great
sponge, because it is capable of holding several
times its own weight of water. As a result of the
living and dead ground cover, the crown cover, and
the organic matter in the soil, the rainfall is fed to
the streams gradually through weeks and months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
instead of a few hours, and the nearby rivers have
a steady, equable flow, instead of alternate stages
of floods and low water.</p>

<p>Closely bound up with the protection of watersheds
is the erosion problem. Without a forest
cover, rain runs off mountain slopes very rapidly,
often carrying with it silt and sand, and, in severe
floods, even rocks and bowlders. A well known
physical law states that the carrying capacity of
a stream increases as the sixth power of its velocity.
In other words, double the velocity of a stream and
you have multiplied its carrying power by 64; increase
its velocity ten times, and you multiply its
carrying power by a million. The delay caused by
the forest cover in each raindrop's journey down a
mountain side not only prevents floods, but also
preserves the fertility of the fields in the valleys
below.</p>

<p>Many streams in the West carry such enormous
amounts of silt that the storage capacity of reservoirs
has been seriously impaired, even within a
comparatively short time. Then, also, there is the
added difficulty and expense of keeping the diversion
works&mdash;the ditches and canals&mdash;free from an
excess of this material. Studies which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
carried on to determine in what way the administration
of the National Forests can keep the destructive
processes of erosion at a minimum have
shown that the balance between the stability of the
soil and rapid erosion on many slopes is so delicate
that only a slight abuse may result in complete loss
of the fertile top soil and permanent changes in the
character of the vegetation.</p>

<p>In August, 1909, the town of Ephraim, on the
Manti National Forest, Utah, experienced a disastrous
flood from Ephraim canyon, which was attributed
in part to the overgrazed condition on the
watershed. An examination made the next spring
clearly demonstrated that the severity of the flood
was a direct result of deterioration of forest, brush,
and grass cover, due to overgrazing during a long
period of years. The canyon was therefore closed
to grazing as an immediate protective measure.
Plans were thereafter made to restore the forest
cover of the canyon by planting.</p>

the forests on the watershed of this river.
</div></div>

<p>In this kind of protection work, as in the case of
forest fires, it has been found that preventive measures
are much more effective and much less costly
than remedial measures. The regulations under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
which the Forests are administered give the Secretary
of Agriculture power to institute preventive
measures. To insure the sufficiency and purity of
the water supply of a municipality or of an irrigation
district, or to prevent floods and snowslides, the
use of watersheds for grazing, timber, special uses,
or settlement is especially restricted when such restriction
is found to be necessary. On steep grass
or timber-covered mountain slopes both grazing and
timber sales are prohibited, if necessary.</p>

<p><i>Public Health.</i> From the relation which the
National Forests bear to the streams that issue from
them, it will be seen that they may exert a great
influence upon the health and general welfare of
the communities in the valleys below. All persons
either permanently or temporarily camped upon
National Forest land are liable to trespass proceedings
if unsanitary conditions result from their
presence. All camp refuse must be disposed of
either by burying or burning. This regulation applies
to hunting and fishing parties, as well as to
large logging camps, sawmills, and construction
camps on National Forest lands. Thus the regulations
strictly guard against the pollution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
water supply of the people who live in the large
towns and cities, and also those who live on the
Forests or near them. The watersheds tributary to
many of the large western cities and towns are
under special protection by the Forest Service.
Under this sanitary regulation, it is possible to
maintain such control of them as will greatly reduce
the danger of typhoid and other enteric diseases.</p>

<p><i>Violation of Game Laws.</i> Wild game, fish and
birds add materially to the enjoyment of the National
Forests by the public, and their protection
and preservation is a duty of Forest officers. Although
this duty rests primarily with the State
the Forest Service assists, as far as practicable, in
the protection of game on the National Forests
from illegal practices. Forest Service officials are
at the same time State Game Wardens. In the
event of a violation of the state game laws, they
either apprehend the offender or report the matter
to the proper state official.</p>

<p>Various kinds of game and bird refuges may be
included within National Forests, depending upon
whether they are created by specific acts of the
State Legislature or by Acts of Congress. In
these refuges, hunting, trapping, willfully disturbing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
or killing any game or bird is prohibited.
Whether the violation occurs in the state game
refuge or the national refuge, the Forest officer has
authority to arrest the offender without warrant.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br /><br />

<span class="subhead">THE SALE AND RENTAL OF NATIONAL FOREST RESOURCES</span></h2>

<p>The timber, the pasture, the water and mineral
resources and the land in the National Forests
are for the use of the people, and they may be
obtained for legitimate use from the local Forest
officers without delay. In fact, the Forest Service
is doing all it can to encourage all kinds of business
which depends upon National Forest resources.</p>

<h3>THE SALE AND DISPOSAL OF NATIONAL FOREST TIMBER</h3>

<p>There has been a steady increase in the amount
and value of the timber cut on the National Forests.
During the fiscal year 1917 over 700,000,000 feet
of timber, valued at almost $1,500,000, was cut,
while almost three times as much was sold. Most
of this was cut in the States of Montana, Oregon,
Idaho, Washington, California and Arizona.</p>

<p>All mature timber on the National Forests which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
may be cut with benefit and in accordance with certain
well-established forestry principles, is for sale
and is advertised and offered as demand arises.
The outstanding feature of government timber
sales is the fact that only the stumpage is sold, the
title of the land remaining with the Government.
The timber is sold in any quantity, so long as the
sale is in accordance with well-established policy.
Large sales require a large initial investment for
constructing a railroad or other means for taking
out the timber, and may even require the construction
of a common carrier from the market to comparatively
inaccessible regions.</p>

<p><i>Government Timber Sale Policy.</i> The National
Forest timber sale policy, first of all, aims to prevent
the loss of this valuable public property
through forest fires. This phase of the policy, however,
is covered under the chapter on protection.
Next, it aims to utilize the ripe timber which can
be marketed and to cut it in such a way as to insure
the restocking of the land with young timber and
the continuance of forest production. The price at
which timber is sold represents, as required by
statute, the appraised market value and a proper
return to the public which owns it. It is disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of in such a way as to prevent its speculative acquisition
and holding, and to prevent monopoly.</p>

<p>National Forest timber has found its way into
both the general, far distant market, and the local
market. But it is the aim of the Forest Service to
first of all provide for the requirements of local communities
and industries, including the free use and
sale at cost to settlers as authorized by statute. It
is also the aim of the Forest Service policy to make
timberlands of agricultural value available for settlement
under conditions which prevent speculative
acquisition but encourage permanent and genuine
farming. According to this policy, land which at
the present time is covered with a good stand of
timber and which has been shown to have a greater
value for agricultural purposes is cleared as soon as
a bona fide sale can be consummated. And, lastly,
it is the aim of this policy to return as soon as possible
the cost of protection and administration of the
National Forests, and to yield a revenue to the
States, since these are entitled by statute to 25 per
cent. of all gross receipts as an offset to the loss of
local taxes through the government ownership of
the forests.</p>

supply for the western people used for domestic use, water power, and irrigation is being protected from pollution
and destruction. View taken on the Rainier National Forest.
</div></div>

<p><i>Annual Yield and Cut.</i> Each year the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of timber which can be cut from each National
Forest, according to sound forestry principles, is
authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture. This
cut is based upon the best available data as to the
amount of mature and over-mature timber needing
removal, and the amount of annual growth on
each Forest. At the present time only a small percentage
of the authorized annual cut of the Forests
is taken. Most Forests cut a very small part of
their annual allotment, but a few Forests cut their
full annual yield, or nearly so. On some Forests,
the entire annual yield is used by local industries
and no timber can be sent to the general market;
on others a very small part of the annual yield is
used by local needs and most of the cut can be sent
to the general market. On the Cascade National
Forest, in Oregon, for instance, the annual production
is estimated at about 200,000,000 feet, while the
present local needs can be supplied by approximately
1,000,000 feet. From such a Forest a
large annual cut can be made for the general market.
On the Deerlodge National Forest, in Montana,
on the other hand, the annual yield is estimated
to be about 40,000,000 feet, all of which is
needed to supply the large copper mines near Butte.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
From Forests like this, no sales for the general
market can be made.</p>

<p>Although the National Forests contain about six
hundred billions of board feet of timber, or about
one-fifth of the standing timber in the United
States, only a small fraction of the available timber
is actually disposed of. This is due to the comparative
inaccessibility of this timber and the presence
of large bodies of privately owned timber
which lie between it and the market. The result
of this condition is that the bulk of the salable timber
on the Forests will be automatically saved until
such a time when most of the privately owned timber
has been cut. In this way, future generations
will benefit and the public will receive a much better
price for it years hence than they could possibly
obtain now.</p>

<p><i>Timber Reconnoissance.</i> Before any timber can
be sold to advantage, however, it is necessary to take
an inventory of the timber resources. In other
words, it is necessary to know where the timber is,
how much there is, and what can be done with it.
This timber estimate, or timber reconnoissance, as
it is called, is also needed to settle questions of title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
arising from the presence of patented lands or valid
claims; to determine if cutting is advisable on a
given area, and, if so, under what stipulations; and
to fix the minimum price at which stumpage is to
be sold. The annual yield, or the amount of timber
grown or produced annually upon an area, must be
the ultimate basis of the annual cut, and this yield
can only be computed after an inventory of the
timber has been made.</p>

<p>Timber reconnoissance (valuation survey or valuation
strips) involves an estimate of the standing
timber by small legal or natural subdivisions of
land, with the necessary land surveys, the preparation
of an accurate topographic and forest type
map, and the compilation of detailed descriptive
notes. These notes deal with the condition and
character of the timber, the most practical methods
of exploitation, the extent and character of the
young growth, and many other factors which affect
the management of timber lands. These data are
secured at a cost of from 3 to 10 cents per acre, depending
upon the accessibility and the topography
of the region and the density of the timber. This
work is carried on both in the summer and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
winter. Up to date, about 21,000,000 acres have
been covered by intensive reconnoissance and about
48,000,000 acres by extensive methods.</p>

<p><i>Logging the Timber.</i> In order that my reader
may better understand various matters connected
with the disposal of National Forest timber, it will
be necessary to give a brief outline of how timber
and other forest products are taken from the woods,
and the different steps necessary before a green
tree in the woods becomes a board or a railroad tie.</p>

<p>The methods of logging used in the National
Forests are essentially the same as those used on
private lands, with the exception of certain details,
such as the protection of young growth, the cutting
of snags, and the disposal of the brush. The methods
used, of course, vary with the locality; they are
different for the Pacific Coast, where donkey engines
are used, than for the Rocky Mountains,
where horses are largely employed. They vary
with the climate, the topography, the size of the timber,
and the kind of product to be harvested. But
a typical logging operation, as carried on in the
Sierras of California, will give an idea of how logs
are taken from the forest.</p>

<p>In the particular operation which I have in mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the timber was located on the western slope of the
mountains between 3,500 and 5,000 feet in elevation.
The slopes were of medium steepness and much of
the timber was on level benches. The large sawmill
was located at the lower edge of the timber and
the logging camp was in the woods near the cutting.
The felling of the trees, which were from
3 to 6 feet in diameter, was done by two men with
a two-man saw. These men are the "fallers."
Two men then cut the tree into logs and still other
men called "swampers" cut the brush and fallen
trees away so that the newly cut timber can be
"skidded" to the railroad. This "skidding" is done
by a powerful, steam-driven stationary donkey-engine,
which is fitted up with a long cable and a
drum. After the log is attached to the cable out
in the woods by means of a "choker," the man in
the woods gives the signal and the engine starts,
revolving the drum and winding up the cable at
the same time pulling the log towards the engine.
Just beside this engine is a platform from which
the logs are loaded directly on flat cars. When six
or eight flat cars are loaded in this manner a locomotive
hauls them to the sawmill where they are
sawed into boards. In this case as soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
boards were cut they were placed in a flume in
which there was a strong stream of water. In this
they floated about 40 miles to a town in the valley
below directly into the company's lumber yard.</p>

<p>In the Rocky Mountains one of the main forest
products derived from the National Forests is railroad
ties. On the particular operation with which
the writer is familiar the Government had sold to
a tie operator about 3,000,000 railroad ties under
a long term contract. This tie operator had a
large contract with a railroad company. The area
of the sale, several thousand acres, was divided or
surveyed into long strips each 100 to 150 feet wide
and from one to one and a half miles long. A large
camp and commissary was established on the area.
There were about 100 tie choppers and each man
was assigned to a strip. On these strips the trees to
be cut were marked by a Forest officer. Trees too
small to make ties were left as a basis for a future
tie operation in from forty to fifty years.</p>

<p>The tie choppers usually worked alone. They
first felled the tree with a saw, cut the lower limbs
off, and marked off the ties on the bark to see how
many ties could be cut from the tree. The tree
was then "scored" with an ax on both sides in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to start making the two flat faces of the tie. These
sides were then chipped with a "broad ax," thus
making two smooth faces. The bark was then
peeled from the other two faces and the tree was
then cut into finished ties. After the ties were
made the top of the tree was lopped, that is, the
branches were cut from the trunk. In this operation
these branches were scattered evenly over the
ground. The tie chopper then cleared a road
through the middle of his strip and "parked" his
ties on the road. He then stamped his private
mark on each tie. In the winter the ties were
"hauled" on large sleds to the river bank. Each
tie chopper's ties were put in a separate pile so
that the company's scaler could count them and
credit them to the man that made them. In the
spring, when the river's banks were full, the ties
were "driven" down the river to the shipping point,
usually a town on a railroad line.</p>

<p>A Forest officer is detailed to an operation of this
kind to inspect the choppers' work and count and
stamp the ties. He sees to it that all trees that
have been marked for cutting are cut, that no trees
not marked have been cut, that young growth is
not unnecessarily injured, that the stumps are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
left too high, that the tops are fully utilized, that
the slashing or brush is disposed of according to
the contract, and that the operator is keeping all
his agreements in the contract.</p>

<p><i>The First Step in Purchasing Government Timber.</i>
After the desired body of timber has been
located, the first step for any one desiring to purchase
government timber is to communicate with
an officer of the National Forest in which the timber
is located. If only a small amount is desired&mdash;less
than $50 in value&mdash;the local Ranger can arrange
to make the sale without delay. Amounts
valued at more than this can be sold only by the
higher officials of the Service, that is the Supervisor,
District Forester, or the Forester, according
to the size of the sale. The Supervisor can sell up
to two million feet; larger sales are made by the
District Forester or the Forester. All sales exceeding
$100 in amount must be advertised, except
those made to homestead settlers and farmers in a
private sale. Sales are advertised in order to secure
the largest number of bidders possible and thus
prevent the monopoly of large bodies of timber by
large timber operators.</p>

<p><i>Procedure in an Advertised Sale.</i> After the applicant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
has selected the body of timber he wishes to
purchase, he is furnished by the Supervisor with a
sample application stating the area, estimated
amount, minimum stumpage price, period allowed
for cutting and removing the timber, and other conditions
to be complied with, following as closely as
possible the form of the final sale agreement.
Usually, also, the purchaser is interested in the
amount of timber which he may cut per acre. For
this reason he visits sample areas on which the trees
have been marked for cutting. A notice of the sale
of the timber is then published, the choice of mediums
and number of insertions depending upon
whether the sale is of local, regional, or general interest.
This notice describes the timber, gives the
minimum stumpage prices that will be accepted,
and specifies the date upon which sealed bids will
be received. The period of advertising is at least
30 days, and in large sales from 3 to 6 months.
Forms for bidding are furnished to the original applicant
and others who signify their intention to
bid. A deposit is required with all bids to show
the good faith of the bidder. In large transactions
this deposit is usually from 3 to 5 per cent. of the
purchase price. On the date specified in the advertisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the Supervisor (or District Forester)
opens all bids received and awards the sale to the
highest bidder. The sale contract is then prepared
and executed by the purchaser.</p>

<p>A specific statement of financial ability is required
in all sales of ten million feet or more, and
in smaller sales in the discretion of the approving
officer. Such a statement may be required before
the approval of the sale application, either formal
or tentative, and in any event before the timber is
awarded to the successful bidder. The contract
must be supported by a suitable bond given by two
responsible sureties or by a surety company authorized
to do business with the United States.</p>

<p><i>Timber Sale Contract Clauses.</i> The sale contract
contains in full all the conditions under which
the cutting is to be done. In all sales of National
Forest stumpage the contract provides that no timber
shall be cut until it has been paid for, and that
it shall not be removed until it has been scaled by a
Forest officer. All live timber is marked or otherwise
designated before cutting, and any merchantable
timber used for logging improvements, such
as houses, bridges, stables, etc., must be scaled and
paid for. In order to secure full utilization of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
timber the maximum stump height is ordinarily
fixed at 18 inches, and merchantable timber must be
used to a specified diameter in the tops, which is adjusted
for each species in accordance with local
manufacturing and market conditions. The officer
in charge of the sale is authorized to vary the stump
height and top diameter in individual cases when
those specified in the contract are not practicable.
The tops must be trimmed up and, as a rule, brush
must be piled and burned, or burned without piling
under the direction of Forest officers. Merchantable
timber which is not cut and removed and
unmarked trees which are cut must be paid for at
double the specified stumpage rates. This extra
charge serves as a penalty.</p>

<p>All camps, buildings, railroads, and other improvements
necessary in logging and manufacturing
the timber may be constructed upon National
Forest land without charge. Railroads which open
up inaccessible regions may be required to be made
common carriers or to transport logs and lumber
for other purchasers or for the Government at
reasonable rates.</p>

<p>Since fire protection is one of the most important
duties of the Forest Service, provision is made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
all contracts that the purchaser must place himself
and employees, as well as the employees of his contractors,
at the disposal of authorized Forest officers
for fighting fires. Reimbursement is made for
such services at the wages in vogue for fighting
fires on the National Forest in question, unless the
fire threatens the timber of the purchaser or property
of the operator, or is started in connection with
the operation. Under these conditions the purchaser
is expected to furnish his available employees
to assist the Government in fire fighting
without charge. Efficient spark arresters are required
on wood and coal burning boilers or locomotives.
Inflammable material must be cleaned up
in the vicinity of logging engines, and other precautions
taken to insure against fire spreading from
this source. Snags and diseased trees upon the sale
area must usually be felled, whether merchantable
or not, in order to remove fire menace and to check
the spread of timber infestations and pests.</p>

<p><i>Special Contract Clauses.</i> Special clauses are
inserted in contracts to meet peculiar and unusual
conditions. These deal with the number of men
the company is to furnish for brush burning; the
time of the year this work is to be done; the construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of fire lines; the manner of scaling timber;
the manner of piling and the location of piles of
material to be scaled; the definition of a merchantable
log; the utilization of tops; the manner or
method of logging to be used; the location of improvements;
the use of timber for the construction
of improvements; the disposal of improvements at
the termination of the contract; where cutting is to
begin and how fast it is to proceed; the percentage
of merchantable timber to be reserved in marking;
and other special clauses recommended by the Bureau
of Entomology for the sale of insect infested
timber.</p>

<p>That the Forest Service timber sale policy and
the various timber sale clauses have met with the
approval of the lumbermen and the timber buyers
of the Western States is attested by the fact that in
the last ten years (from July 1, 1907, to June 30,
1917) there have been nearly 75,000 purchasers of
National Forest timber and that between these two
dates the annual number of timber sales has increased
from 5,062 in the fiscal year 1908 to 11,608
in the fiscal year 1917. No better evidence could
be cited of the confidence which the lumbermen have
in the Forest Service method of doing business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<i>When the Operation May Begin.</i> As soon as
the contract has been executed and the first payment
has been made a portion of the timber is
marked for cutting and the purchaser may begin
operations at once. Sometimes cutting in advance
of the execution of the contract is allowed to prevent
serious hardship and unnecessary delay and
expense on the part of the purchaser.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>Marking the Timber for Cutting.</i> In order to
insure a proper restocking of the ground, all live
trees must be marked or otherwise designated by a
Forest officer before cutting can commence. Usually
from 1/10 to 1/3 of the stand is reserved, either
scattered over the entire tract or distributed in
groups. These trees are left for various reasons,
depending upon circumstances. The most important
consideration is, of course, to leave enough
seed trees to restock the cut-over area. On steep
slopes a certain number of trees must be left to
protect the watershed and to prevent the erosion of
the soil. Many species of trees are subject to
windthrow when the stand is thinned out. To
counteract this tendency a sufficient number of
trees must be left to prevent the wind from getting
an unobstructed sweep. In many semi-arid portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the West additional trees must be left standing
to protect the forest from excessive drying and
to prevent the ground from being occupied by useless
tree weeds and brush. Often, especially along
highways, trees are left for their scenic effect.
From an economic standpoint it is important sometimes
to leave trees in order to make a second cut
worth while.</p>

<p>Where only dead timber is purchased, and no
living trees are cut, or where patches of forest are to
be cut clean, Forest officers, instead of marking
every tree to be removed, blaze and mark a boundary
of the cutting area or patch and instruct the
purchaser accordingly. Where individual trees are
marked they are blazed and stamped "U. S." next
to the ground on the lowest side of the stump.
Additional blazes may be made several feet above
the ground whenever desired by the purchaser for
the convenience of his "fallers" or where deep snow
may conceal the lower mark from the "fallers."
Where both kinds of blazes are used, one man, in
fairly dense pine timber, can mark from 500 to
1,000 trees in a day. Under no condition may unmarked
or undesignated trees be cut by the purchaser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
The system of marking and the proportion of the
timber to be cut is explained to purchasers by marking
sample areas before the contract is executed.
The cost of logging under the methods of marking
adopted is compensated fully in the stumpage appraisal.</p>

<p><i>Scaling, Measuring, and Stamping.</i> Unless
timber is sold by estimate, it must be scaled,
counted, or measured before it is removed from the
cutting area or place agreed upon for this purpose.
In addition it must be stamped by a Forest officer
with a regulation marking ax or similar instrument.
Payment is made upon the actual scale,
count or measure, with due allowance for defect.</p>

<p>All National Forest timber is sold under specifications
which are in accordance with those in commercial
use, such as logs by the thousand board feet,
ties by the piece, poles by length and top diameter,
shingle bolts by the cord, and mining timbers by
the linear foot. All logs are scaled at the small
end.</p>

</div></div>

<p>All saw timber is scaled by the Scribner Decimal
C log rule. In order to permit scaling at reasonable
cost to the Forest Service, purchasers may be
required, where the cost of logging may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
unduly increased, to skid and pile the logs for
scaling. Piles and skidways must be constructed
so as to permit economical scaling and when necessary
and practicable the purchaser is required to
mark the small ends of the logs to avoid misunderstanding
when they are scaled on the pile.</p>

<p>Logs or other material that has been scaled or
measured are designated by a "US" stamp impressed
in the wood so that the material may not
be scaled again by mistake. Each merchantable
log scaled is stamped on at least one end and unmerchantable
or defective logs are stamped "US"
in a circle. Material other than saw logs, such as
mine timber, ties, posts, poles, or piling, after scaling,
is stamped on at least one end. Cord wood is
stamped at both the top and bottom of each rick.</p>

<p>On all National Forests except those in Alaska
and west of the summit of the Cascades in Washington
and Oregon, logs over 16 feet are scaled as
two or more logs as far as practicable in lengths of
not less than 12 feet. In Alaska and parts of Oregon
and Washington logs up to and including 32
feet in length are scaled as one log; logs from
32 to 64 feet inclusive are scaled as two logs as
nearly equal in length as possible in even feet. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
diameters are measured inside the bark at the top
end of the log and diameters are rounded off to the
nearest inch above or below the actual diameter.</p>

<p>In the case of logs each one is numbered and the
number entered in a scale book with the corresponding
board foot scale of the log. In the case of ties,
posts, poles, mining timbers, etc., each pile or skidway
is numbered and the count or scale entered
opposite the corresponding number in the scale
book.</p>

<p><i>Disposal of Slash.</i> One of the most important
features in National Forest timber sales is the disposal
of the brush or slash after logging. On account
of the great diversity of conditions which
obtain on the Forests, the best way to dispose of
brush is not everywhere the same. Piling and
burning is required where the fire risk is great;
otherwise the method promising the best silvicultural
results is used.</p>

are unloaded and sawn into lumber. During the fiscal year 1917
timber sales on the National Forests brought into the National Treasury
almost $1,700,000.00. Photo by the author.
</div></div>

<p>When piling and burning is necessary, all tops
and débris, including large chips made from hewing
ties, are piled at a safe distance from standing trees.
The piles are not allowed to be made in groups of
seedlings or young growth, against dead snags, near
living trees, or on stumps, large tops or logs, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
wherever possible in openings. The piles are
adapted to the size of the opening in which they are
made and must be made sufficiently compact to
kindle easily and burn cleanly. The ideal pile is of
medium size, conical in shape, compact, from 5 to 7
feet in diameter at the base and from 4 to 5 feet
high. Brush piling and burning is an art which
can only be acquired after long experience.</p>

<p>Brush is scattered whenever this method promises
the best silvicultural results, unless there is
serious danger from fire on account of dense timber
and reproduction. The scattered brush is intended
to afford protection to seedlings from excessive
transpiration and from trampling by stock and to
protect the soil from erosion.</p>

<p>Ground burning may be advisable where clean
cutting has been employed, to expose the loose mineral
soil for better seed germination. When this
method is used the purchaser is required to clear a
fire line around the area to be burned and to furnish
adequate help to the Forest officer who supervises
the burning.</p>

<p>Frequently brush is burned as the cutting progresses.
Fires are started at convenient points and
the brush is thrown on them as it is lopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Where brush burning is necessary it is not advisable,
ordinarily, to burn over an entire sale area.
It is frequently possible to burn the brush so as to
form broad fire lines, particularly along railroads
or wagon roads. The best times for brush burning
are after a light fall of snow or rain, early in the
spring before the snow has melted or the dry season
has begun or during or immediately after summer
rains. Brush disposal must always keep pace with
logging except when the depth of snow or other
reasons make proper disposal impossible. Often
the brush must lay in piles at least one season before
it becomes dry enough to burn.</p>

<p><i>Payment for Timber.</i> Payment must be made
for all timber in advance of cutting. This, however,
does not imply that one advance payment
must be made to cover the stumpage value of all the
timber included in the sale. Frequent installments
are allowed sufficient usually to cover the cut of one
or two months.</p>

<p>This arrangement makes it possible to secure
large tracts of National Forest timber at a very
slight initial outlay and to hold them with almost
no interest charges. The other usual carrying
charges, namely, taxes and fire protection, are eliminated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The timber is protected from fire by the
United States throughout the life of the contract.
The money deposited to secure cutting in advance
of the execution of the contract may be credited
towards the amount to accompany the bid.</p>

<p><i>Stumpage Rates.</i> The minimum stumpage rates
applicable in each proposed sale are determined by
a careful study of the conditions in the particular
case. Stumpage rates are the actual market value
of the timber. They are based upon the quality of
the timber and the character of its commercial products;
the estimated cost of logging, transportation,
and manufacture; the investment required on the
part of the operator; the selling value of the product;
and a fair profit to the purchaser. The estimated
profit depends upon the size and the permanency
of the operation and the degree of risk
involved. The cost of brush disposal, protection of
young growth, logging only marked timber and
other requirements of the Forest Service is fully
considered in appraising stumpage rates.</p>

<p>Timber is ordinarily appraised at the rates indicated
for the most valuable products to which it is
suited and for which an established market exists.
Merchantable dead timber is appraised at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rate as green timber of the same species unless it is
clearly shown that the products manufactured from
it command a lower market price or that logging
costs are higher.</p>

<p><i>Cutting Period.</i> Ordinarily the cutting period
allowed in each sale is only sufficient to permit the
removal of the timber at a reasonable rate, approximately
equivalent to the working capacity of the
plant. Sales of accessible timber usually do not
exceed 5 years in length. However, in the case of
inaccessible tracts requiring a large investment for
transportation facilities an exception is made and
periods of from 15 to 20 years may be granted.</p>

<p><i>Readjustment of Stumpage Rates.</i> In all sales
exceeding 5 years in length provision is made to
have the stumpage rates readjusted by the Forester
at the end of three or five year intervals to
meet changing market and manufacturing conditions.</p>

<p><i>Refunds.</i> Deposits to cover or secure advance
cutting or to accompany bids apply on the first payment
if a sale is awarded to the depositor; otherwise
they will be refunded. Refunds are also made
to the purchaser if the last payment is in excess of
the value of the timber that is cut.</p>

<h3>THE DISPOSAL OF TIMBER TO HOMESTEAD SETTLERS AND UNDER FREE USE</h3>

<p>Besides selling the timber and other forest products
outright, as has just been described, some timber
is sold to settlers at cost and much timber is
given away to the local people under the free use
policy.</p>

<p><i>Sales to Homestead Settlers and Farmers.</i>
Sales to homestead settlers and farmers are made
without advertisement in any amount desired, at
the price fixed annually for each National Forest
region of similar conditions by the Secretary, as
equivalent to the actual cost of making and administering
such sales. Only material to be used by
the purchaser for domestic purposes exclusively on
homesteads or farms is sold in this way. Such uses
include the construction or repair of farm buildings,
fences, and other improvements and fuel. Such
sales are restricted to mature dead and down timber
which may be cut without injury to the forest.</p>

<p><i>Free Use.</i> Free use of timber is granted primarily
to aid in the protection and silvicultural improvement
of the Forests. Hence the material
taken is, except in unusual cases, restricted to dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
insect infested and diseased timber, and thinnings.
Green material may be taken in exceptional cases
where its refusal would clearly cause unwarranted
hardship. The use of such material is granted
freely: (1) To bona fide settlers, miners, residents,
prospectors, for fire wood, fencing, building,
mining, prospecting, and other domestic purposes;
and to any one in case its removal is necessary for
the welfare of the Forest; (2) for the construction
of telephone lines when necessary for the protection
of forests from fire; (3) to certain branches
of the Federal Government. Free use is not
granted for commercial purposes or of use in any
business, including sawmills, hotels, stores, companies
or corporations. Such persons are required to
purchase their timber.</p>

<p>The aggregate amount of free use material
granted annually to any user must not exceed $20
in value, except in cases of unusual need or of dead
or insect infested timber, the removal of which
would be a benefit to the forest, or in the case of
any timber which should be removed and whose sale
under contract cannot be effected. In these cases
the amount may be extended to $100. Supervisors
have authority to grant free use permits up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
$100, District Foresters up to $500, and larger
amounts must have the approval of the Forester.</p>

<p>Free use material is appraised in the same manner
and in accordance with the same principles as
timber purchased under sale agreements. The
valuation of such material is at the same rate as
that prevailing for similar grades of stumpage in
current sales in the same locality.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the free use business may be
appreciated from the fact that during the fiscal
year 1917 there were 41,427 individuals or companies
who received timber under this policy. The
total amount thus given away was 113,073,000
board feet valued at over $150,000.</p>

<p>Permits for this use are required for green material,
but dead timber may be taken without a permit.
Supervisors designate as free-use areas certain
portions or all of any National Forest and
settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors may cut
and remove from such areas free of charge under
Forest Service regulations any timber needed for
their own use for firewood, fencing, buildings, mining,
prospecting, or other domestic purposes.</p>

<p>Material cut under free-use regulations must not
be removed from the cutting area until scaled or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
measured by a Forest officer. In some cases this
requirement is waived when by it the needs of the
users are met with greater dispatch and the cost of
administration is thereby reduced. The free-use
applicant is required to utilize the trees cut in accordance
with local Forest Service practice and he
is required to avoid unnecessary damage to young
growth and standing timber.</p>

<h3>TIMBER SETTLEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE USE</h3>

<p>When timber on National Forest land is cut,
damaged, killed, or destroyed in connection with
the enjoyment of a right-of-way or other special
use, it is not necessary to advertise it for sale, but
payment therefor is required at not less than the
minimum rate established by the Secretary of Agriculture.
Timber removed in this way is usually
scaled, measured, or counted and the procedure is
identical with that of a timber sale. But where
timber is destroyed or where it is not worked up in
measurable form or where the cutting is done in
such a way that scaling is impracticable, settlement
is required on the basis of an estimate.</p>

<p>In 1912 a new branch of the Southern Pacific
Railroad was built across a portion of the Lassen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
National Forest in California. The company was
going to use some of the timber, but most of it was
to be destroyed or disposed of in the easiest manner.
Scaling was impossible, so the company paid for
the timber&mdash;about $10,000&mdash;on the basis of a careful
estimate made by the writer, then Forest
Examiner.</p>

<p>The charge for all such timber is made on the
basis of the current stumpage rates for timber of
like quality and accessibility included in sales for
all classes of material which have to be cut or destroyed
and which are commonly salable on the
Forest.</p>

<p>Timber is often used by the Forest Service itself
in the administration of the National Forests.
The Forester, District Foresters, and the Supervisors
are authorized to sell or dispose of under
free use or otherwise, within the amount each one
is authorized to sell, any timber upon the National
Forests when such removal is actually necessary to
protect the Forest from ravages or destruction, or
when the use or removal of the timber is necessary
in the construction of roads, trails, cabins, and
other improvements on the National Forests or in
experiments conducted by the Forest Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE RENTAL OF NATIONAL FOREST RANGE LANDS</h3>

<p>The forage crop on the National Forests is for
the use of the sheep and cattle of the western stockmen
and it is procured by means of grazing permits
which are issued and charged for upon a per
capita basis. The primary objects of the administration
of government grazing lands are: the protection
and conservative use of all National Forest
land adapted to grazing; the permanent good of
the live stock industry through the proper care and
use of grazing lands; and the protection of the settler
and home builder against unfair competition
in the use of the range.</p>

<p><i>Importance of the Live Stock Industry.</i> The
grazing business, more than any other feature of
National Forest management, is immensely practical,
because it is immediately concerned with human
interests. This industry furnishes not only
meat, but leather, wool, and many by-products.</p>

<p>That the National Forests play a big part in the
maintenance of this industry there can be little
doubt, for it has been estimated recently that 30
per cent. of the sheep and 20 per cent. of the cattle
of the far Western States are grazed in the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Forests. The Forests contain by far the
largest part of the summer range lands in the far
Western States and hence are of paramount importance.
The winter grazing lands in the West
are so much greater in area than the summer lands,
that for this reason also National Forest range
lands are in great demand.</p>

<p><i>Permits Issued in 1917.</i> During the fiscal year
1917 more than 31,000 permits to graze cattle, hogs,
or horses, and over 5,500 permits to graze sheep
or goats were issued. These permits provided for
2,054,384 cattle, 7,586,034 sheep, about 100,000
horses, about 50,000 goats, and about 3,000 hogs.
The total receipts for 1917 were over $1,500,000.
The gross receipts to the owners of the stock
probably exceeded $50,000,000 and the capital invested
in the stock no doubt amounted to over
$200,000,000.</p>

<p>An idea of the growth of the grazing business
may be gotten from the Forest Service statistics for
the fiscal years 1908 and 1917. The increase in
the number of permits and the volume of the business
is due primarily to a better administration and
better regulation of grazing interests and more
specifically to the increase in the carrying capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of government lands by wise and restricted use.
Between these two fiscal years there was no appreciable
increase in the total area of the Forests
which would account for the increased business.
In 1908 there were issued 19,845 permits for 1,382,221
cattle, horses and hogs; in 1917 there were issued
31,136 permits for 2,054,384 animals. In
1908 there were issued 4,282 permits for 7,087,111
sheep and goats; in 1917 5,502 permits were issued
for 7,586,034 sheep and goats. The number of
cattle and horses grazed has increased therefore by
50 per cent. and the number of sheep and goats
by 7 per cent. The total receipts have increased
from $962,829.40 in 1908 to $1,549,794.76 in 1917.</p>

<p><i>Kinds of Range, Grazing Seasons, and Methods
of Handling Stock.</i> For the proper understanding
of the grazing business on the National Forests
it is necessary to know something about the different
kinds of range, the length of grazing seasons,
and the methods of handling different classes of
stock. Sheep and goat range differs materially
from cattle and horse range and the proper distribution
of stock over a National Forest cannot be
effected unless this difference is recognized. Sheep
and goat range usually consists of low shrubs or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
brush and is known collectively as "browse"; cattle
and horses subsist mainly upon grass, flowering
plants and herbs. Sheep feel more at home on
high mountain slopes, while cattle and horses range
usually on the lower slopes and in the valleys, and
especially in the broad meadows, around lakes and
along streams. Sheep are more apt to find feed
in the forests, that is under the trees; cattle prefer
the open; they usually avoid the forest, preferring
to keep out on the open meadows and grassy slopes.</p>

<p>Naturally some ranges have feed at some seasons
of the year and other ranges at other seasons.
Some of the National Forests in California extend
from an elevation of a few hundred feet in the foothills
of the great valleys to an elevation of more
than 10,000 feet at the crest of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains. The lower foothills afford excellent
feed soon after the beginning of the fall rains in
November and, due to the very mild winter which
this region enjoys, there is excellent feed in February
and March. This is known as winter range.
The medium high slopes of the mountains have a
later growing season and the sheep and cattle
reach there about June and stay until August or
September. Still higher up the forage matures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
later and the grazing season extends from August
until November. At these elevations the snowbanks
usually lie until July and the growing season
is very short, for the new snow usually buries the
vegetation about the first of November. Thus
stockmen have what they call "winter range,"
"summer range," and "fall range," depending upon
what seasons of the year the forage crop can be
utilized. The National Forests on the whole contain
very little winter range, hence stockmen must
move their stock in the fall to private lands at
lower elevations either where the climate is considerably
warmer or where there is very little snowfall.
A large part of the western winter grazing lands
are in regions of light snowfall, such as at the lower
elevations in Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, and Colorado.
Here the stock feeds on dry grass. Stockmen
who cannot get winter range lands must feed
their stock at ranches.</p>

<p>The characteristic habits of sheep and cattle require
that they be handled differently on the range.
Sheep are herded in bands while cattle are handled
in scattered groups. The new and approved
method of handling sheep called the "burro system"
calls for a burro with the sheep to pack the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
herder's blankets and provisions. The herder
camps where night overtakes him. The herder and
his band keep moving over the allotted range from
one camp to another until he has covered the whole
range. After leaving his last camp he is ready to
begin all over again, since the feed near the camp
where he began has had two to three weeks' time
to grow a new crop. Cattle usually run loose singly
or in groups on their allotted range. Usually
a range rider is camped on the range to keep the
cattle from straying to other ranges. He salts the
cattle to keep them on their own range, takes care
of cattle that have gotten sick, and takes care of
the stock in other ways.</p>

<p><i>Grazing Districts and Grazing Units.</i> The Secretary
of Agriculture not only has the authority
to regulate grazing and prescribe the schedule of
grazing fees to be charged but he also regulates
the number and class of stock which are allowed to
graze on each National Forest annually.</p>

<p>The ranges within the National Forests are used
by the kind of stock for which they are best adapted
except when this would not be consistent with the
welfare of local residents or the proper protection
of the Forests. For convenience in administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Forests are divided into grazing districts. A typical
Forest is divided into from 4 to 6 districts which
may be natural grazing units, natural administrative
units (coinciding with the Ranger districts), or
parts of the Forest used by different classes of stock
or parts of the Forest having different lengths of
grazing seasons. Each grazing district is also subdivided
into smaller divisions, units, or allotments.
These are usually natural divisions defined by topographic
boundaries, such as ridges, mountains,
streams, etc., or more or less artificial divisions
determined by the class of stock which uses them.
For example, cattle and horses ordinarily graze in
the valleys along the streams, while sheep and goats
graze the crests of ridges and the slopes of mountains
and will cross none but shallow streams.
Each range division or unit is usually given a well-known
local name, such as "Duck Lake Unit" or
"Clover Valley Unit." One or more stockmen may
be allotted to such a unit, depending upon the size
of the unit and the number of animals it can feed.
If only one stockman uses it, it becomes an individual
allotment. Usually a sheep owner with several
large bands of sheep is allotted one large unit
adapted to sheep grazing, while a large unit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
adapted to cattle and horses may be allotted to one
large cattle owner or to two or more smaller owners.
The manner in which sheep and goats are
handled makes individual allotments both practicable
and desirable.</p>

<p>The boundaries of range allotments are usually
well defined. In the case of sheep they are marked
with cloth posters. In most Forests range allotments
are fairly well settled. Each stockman gets
with his permit each spring a small map showing
his own range and the surrounding ranges.</p>

<p><i>Who Are Entitled to Grazing Privileges.</i> The
Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to permit,
regulate, or prohibit grazing on the National
Forests. Under his direction the Forest Service
allows the use of the forage crop as fully as the
proper care and protection of the National Forests
and the water supply permit. The grazing use of
the National Forest lands is therefore only a personal
and non-transferable privilege. This privilege
is a temporary one, allowable under the law
only when it does not interfere with the purposes
for which the National Forests were created. It is
non-transferable because it is based upon the possession
of certain qualifications peculiar to the permittee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
To understand these qualifications it is
necessary to briefly look into the history of the grazing
of live stock on the western grazing lands.</p>

</div></div>

<p>By long use of the public lands of the United
States for grazing purposes, long before the National
Forests were created, stock owners have been
allowed to graze their stock upon such lands under
certain conditions of occupancy, residence, and
ownership of improved lands and water rights.
This use, continuing through a long period of
years, has, in the absence of congressional legislation,
been commonly accepted in many communities,
even receiving the recognition of certain of the
courts. It was allowed under "unwritten law," as
it were, only by the passive consent of the United
States, but by force of the presidential proclamation
creating National Forests, such passive consent
ceased, being superseded by definite regulations
by the Secretary of Agriculture prescribed
under the authority of Congress. Therefore grazing
stock on the Forests, as it was done before the
Forests were created, is trespass against the United
States. Due to the fact that local stockmen have
used certain public ranges year after year by the
passive consent of the United States, these stockmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
are recognized in these localities as having
preference rights or equities in the use of range
lands. These equities form the basis upon which
grazing privileges are allowed.</p>

<p>Grazing permits are issued only to persons entitled
to share in the use of the range within the National
Forests by reason of their fulfilling certain
conditions or requirements. Prior use and occupancy
of National Forest lands for grazing purposes
is the first and foremost requirement. Local
residence and ownership of improved ranch property
within or near the Forest and dependence
upon government range are also conditions that
may entitle a stockman to grazing privileges. The
Forest Service also recognizes those stockmen who
have acquired by purchase or inheritance stock
grazed upon National Forest lands under permit
and improved ranch property used in connection
with the stock, provided circumstances warrant the
renewal of the permit issued to the former owner.
The regular use of a range during its open season
for several successive years before the creation of
the National Forest and under grazing permit
thereafter is what is meant by "prior use" or "regular
occupancy." The longer the period or use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
greater the preference right. No one can acquire
this right to the use of National Forest range, nor
can it be bought or sold, but stockmen may acquire
a preference in the allotment of grazing privileges.
This preference right does not entitle him to continued
use of a certain part of a Forest, but only to
preference over other applicants less entitled to
consideration in the use of the ranges open to the
class of stock which he wishes to graze. Certain
stockmen may be given preference in ranges secured
by prior use and occupancy supplemented by
heavy investments in improved property and water
rights.</p>

<p>Citizens of the United States are given preference
in the use of the National Forests, but persons
who are not citizens may be allowed grazing permits
provided they are bona fide residents and owners of
improved ranch property either within or adjacent
to a National Forest. Regular occupants of the
range who own and reside upon improved ranch
property in or near National Forests are given first
consideration, but will be limited to a number
which will not exclude regular occupants who reside
or whose stock are wintered at a greater distance
from the National Forests. With this provision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
applicants for grazing permits are given
preference in the following order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang2">Class&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons owning and residing upon improved ranch
property within or near a National Forest who are dependent
upon National Forests for range and who do not
own more than a limited number of stock (known as the
protective limit).</p>

<p class="hang2">Class&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular users of National Forests range who do
not own improved ranch property within or near a National
Forest, and persons owning such ranch property
but who own numbers of stock in excess of the established
limit.</p>

<p class="hang2">Class&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons who are not regular users of the National
Forest range and who do not own improved ranch property
within or near a National Forest. Such persons are
not granted permits upon Forests which are fully occupied
by classes A and B. Classes B and C are not
allowed to increase the number of stock grazed under
permit except by the purchase of other permitted stock.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">From this classification it is very evident that the
small local stockmen who own approximately from
30 to 300 head of cattle and from 500 to 2,000 head
of sheep and who own and reside upon the ranches
near the Forests are given the preference in the allotment
of grazing privileges.</p>

<p><i>Grazing Permits.</i> Various kinds of grazing permits
are required each year on the National Forests.
These are known as ordinary grazing permits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
on-and-off permits, private land permits, and
crossing permits.</p>

<p>All persons must secure permits before grazing
any stock on a National Forest except for the few
head in actual use by prospectors, campers, ranchers,
stockmen, and travelers who use saddle, pack
and work animals, and milch cows in connection
with permitted operations on the National Forests.
Under these conditions 10 head are allowed to
graze without permit.</p>

<p>Persons owning stock which regularly graze on
ranges partially included within a National Forest,
or upon range which includes private land may be
granted permits for such portions of their stock as
the circumstances appear to justify. This regulation
provides for cases where only a part of a natural
range unit is National Forest land, and where
the economical use of the entire unit can be secured
only by the utilization of the Forest land in connection
with the other land. The regulation contemplates
a movement of the stock governed by
natural conditions, between the Forest range and
the adjoining outside range, or between Forest
land and intermingled private land. This is called
an on-and-off permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Permits on account of private lands are issued to
persons who own, or who have leased from the
owners, unfenced lands within any National Forest
which are so situated and of such a character that
they may be used by other permitted stock to an
extent rendering the exchange advantageous to the
Government. The permits allow the permittees to
graze upon National Forest land, free of charge,
the number of stock which the private lands will
support, by waiving the right to the exclusive use
of the private land and allowing it to remain open
to other stock grazed on National Forest land under
permit.</p>

<p>The regular grazing permit carries with it the
privilege of driving the permitted stock over National
Forest lands to and from the allotted ranges
at the beginning and end of the grazing season
and from the range to the most accessible shearing,
dipping, and shipping points during the term of the
permit. But crossing permits are necessary for
crossing stock over National Forest lands to points
beyond the National Forest, for crossing stock to
private lands within a National Forest, or for crossing
stock to reach dipping vats or railroad shipping
points. Rangers sometimes are detailed to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the stock and see that there is no delay or
trespassing. No charge is made for crossing permits,
but it is absolutely necessary that persons
crossing stock comply with the regulations governing
the National Forests and with the quarantine
regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture
and the state authorities.</p>

<p><i>Grazing Fees.</i> The full grazing fee is charged
on all animals under 6 months of age which are not
the natural increase of stock upon which the fees
are paid. Animals under 6 months which are the
natural increase of permitted stock are not charged
for. A reasonable fee is charged for grazing all
kinds of live stock on National Forests. The rates
are based upon the yearlong rate for cattle, which is
from 60 cents to $1.50 per head, depending upon
conditions on the Forest. The yearlong rates for
horses are 25 per cent. more and the yearlong rate
for swine 25 per cent. less than the rate for cattle.
The rate for sheep is 25 per cent. of the yearlong
rate for cattle. The rates for all kinds of
stock for periods shorter than yearlong are computed
in proportion to the length of the season during
which the stock use National Forest lands. All
grazing fees are payable in advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
When notice of the grazing allowance, periods,
and rates for the year has been received by the
Supervisor he gives public notice of a date on or
before which all applications for grazing must be
presented to him. These public notices are posted
in conspicuous places, usually in the post offices.
Applications for grazing permits are submitted on
blank forms furnished by the Supervisor. As soon
as an applicant for a grazing permit is notified by
the Supervisor that his application has been approved,
he must remit the amount due for grazing
fees to the District Fiscal Agent and upon receipt
of notice by the Supervisor that payment has been
made a permit is issued allowing the stock to enter
the Forest and remain during the period specified.
All grazing fees are payable in advance and the
stock is not allowed to enter the National Forest
unless payment has been made.</p>

<p><i>Stock Associations.</i> The thirty or more grazing
regulations effective on the National Forests are
for the primary purpose of making the National
Forest range lands as useful as possible to the
people consistent with their protection and perpetuation.
It is clearly impossible to meet the wishes
and needs of each individual user, but it is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
entirely possible to meet the wishes of the majority
of users if made known through an organization.
The organization of stock associations is encouraged
by the Forest Service and the opinions and
wishes of their advisory boards are recognized when
they represent general rather than individual or
personal interests. It is often possible through
these organizations to construct range improvements
such as corrals, drift fences, roads, trails, and
sources of water supply for the common good of
the members of the organization and paid for by
them.</p>

<p><i>Protective and Maximum Limits.</i> In order to
secure an equitable distribution of grazing privileges,
the District Forester establishes protective
limits covering the number of stock for which the
permits of Class A owners will be exempt from
reduction in the renewal of their permits. Permits
for numbers in excess of the protective limits will
be subject to necessary reductions and will not be
subject to increase in number except through purchase
of stock or ranches of other permittees.</p>

<div class="caption">Figure 76. Grazing cattle on a National Forest in Colorado.
Permits were issued during 1917 to graze over 2,000,000 cattle, horses,

</div></div>

<p>Protective limits are established to protect permittees
from reduction in the number of stock
which they are allowed to graze under permit below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a point where the business becomes too small to be
handled at a profit or to contribute its proper share
toward the maintenance of a home. The average
number of stock which a settler must graze in order
to utilize the products of his farm and derive a
reasonable profit is determined upon each Forest
or, if necessary, upon each grazing district thereof,
and serves as the basis for the protective limit.
Protective limits have been established for various
Forests running from 25 to 300 head of cattle and
from 500 to 2,000 head of sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Increases above the protective limit are allowed
only to purchasers of stock and ranches of permit
holders and any such increase must not exceed the
maximum limit. Class A permittees owning a less
number of stock than the protective limit are allowed
to increase their number gradually. Whenever
it is found necessary to reduce the number of
stock allowed in any National Forest, Class C stock
is excluded before the other classes are reduced.
The reduction on a sliding scale is then applied to
Class B owners. Class A owners are exempt from
reduction. When new stock owners are allowed
the use of National Forest range upon a Forest
already fully stocked, reductions in the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
permitted stock of Class B and C owners is made
in order to make room for the new man. Thus it is
seen that the matter of protective limits is actually
a protection to the small stock owner; he is protected
from the monopoly of the range by big corporations.</p>

<p>When necessary to prevent monopoly of the
range by large stock owners, the District Forester
establishes maximum limits in the number of stock
for which a permit may be issued to any one person,
firm or corporation.</p>

<p><i>Prohibition of Grazing.</i> It often becomes necessary
to prohibit all grazing on an area within a
National Forest or at least to materially reduce the
amount of stock which is allowed to graze on a given
area. Sheep may be excluded from a timber-sale
area for a certain number of years after cutting or
until the reproduction has become well established.
Where planting operations are being carried on it
is usually necessary to exclude all classes of stock.
If investigations show that grazing is responsible
for the lack of reproduction over a considerable
area, the area or a portion of it may be withdrawn
from range use until young growth has become
established again. The watersheds of streams supplying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
water for irrigation, municipal or domestic
purposes may be closed to grazing of any or all
kinds of domestic stock when necessary to prevent
erosion and floods or diminution in water supply.
Camping grounds required for the accommodation
of the public may be closed to the grazing of permitted
stock. Limited areas which are the natural
breeding or feeding grounds of game animals or
birds may be closed to grazing. Areas within National
Forests infested seriously by poisonous
plants may be closed to grazing.</p>

<p><i>Protection of Grazing Interests.</i> The protection
of National Forest grazing interests is secured
by the prevention of overgrazing, by the prevention
of damage to roads, trails, or water sources, by
the proper bedding of sheep and goats, by the
proper disposition of carcasses, by salting the stock
and by the proper observation of the national and
state live stock and quarantine laws.</p>

<p>When an owner, who has a permit, is ready to
drive in his stock upon the National Forest he must
notify the nearest Forest officer concerning the
number to be driven in. If called upon to do so he
must provide for having his stock counted before
entering a National Forest. Each permittee must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
repair all damage to roads or trails caused by the
presence of his stock. Sheep and goats are not allowed
to be bedded more than three nights in succession
in the same place (except during the lambing
season) and must not be bedded within 300
yards of any running or living spring. The carcasses
of all animals which die on the National Forests
from contagious or infectious diseases must be
burned and are not permitted to lie in the close
vicinity of water. In order to facilitate the handling
of stock and prevent their straying off their
range, they must be salted at regular intervals and
at regular places.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the moving of stock by
stockmen from their home ranches to their grazing
allotments and to minimize the damage of grazing
animals to the Forests, stock driveways are established
over regular routes of travel.</p>

<h3>SPECIAL USES</h3>

<p>All uses of National Forest lands and resources
permitted by the Secretary of Agriculture, except
those specifically provided for in the regulations
covering water power, timber sales, timber settlement,
the free use of timber, and grazing, are designated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
"special uses." Among these are the use or
occupancy of lands for residences, farms, apiaries,
dairies, schools, churches, stores, mills, factories,
hotels, sanitariums, summer resorts, telephone and
telegraph lines, roads and railways; the occupancy
of lands for dams, reservoirs and conduits not used
for power purposes; and the use of stone, sand, and
gravel. No charge is made for a large number of
these permits, some of which are the following:
(1) agricultural use by applicants having preference
rights under the Act of June 11, 1906; (2)
schools, churches, and cemeteries; (3) cabins for
the use of miners, prospectors, trappers, and stockmen
in connection with grazing permits; (4) saw
mills sawing principally National Forest timber;
(5) conduits, and reservoirs for irrigation or mining
or for municipal water supply; (6) roads and
trails (which must be free public highways); (7)
telephone lines and telegraph lines with free use of
poles and connections for the Forest Service.</p>

<p>The occupancy and use of National Forest land
or resources under a special use permit (except
those given free of charge) are conditioned upon
the payment of a charge and are based upon certain
rates. Agricultural use of land is given to permittees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
at a charge of from 25 cents to $1.00 an acre.
Not over 160 acres are allowed to any one permittee.
Cabins cost from $3.00 to $5.00; hay cutting
from 20 to 50 cents an acre; hotels and roadhouses
from $10.00 to $50.00; pastures from 4 to 25 cents
per acre; residences covering from one to three
acres cost from $5.00 to $25.00; resorts from $10.00
to $50.00; stores from $5.00 to $50.00 for two acres
or less; and other uses in proportion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the use that is purchased most of all on
the National Forests is that for residences and summer
homes. On many of the Forests they are already
in great demand. A large proportion of the
population of the far Western States seek the cool
and invigorating air of the mountains in the early
summer because the heat of the valleys, especially
in California, is almost unbearable.</p>

<p>There are many desirable pieces of land on the
National Forests that are being reserved by the
Forest Service especially for this purpose for the
people of the neighboring towns. For example, on
the Angeles National Forest in California the Supervisor
had about 250 suitable sites surveyed in one
picturesque canyon and in six months 226 of them
were under special use permits as summer homes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
A large reservoir&mdash;Huntington Lake&mdash;was constructed
on the Sierra National Forest in California
as the result of a dam constructed by a hydro-electric
power company. Immediately there was a
keen demand among the residents of San Joaquin
Valley for summer homes on the shores of the lake.
In a few years it is expected there will be a permanent
summer colony of from 2,000 to 3,000 people.
The Forest Service has already authorized an
expenditure of $1,500 in order to furnish an adequate
supply of domestic water for the colony.</p>

<h3>CLAIMS AND SETTLEMENT</h3>

<p>Claims can be initiated upon National Forest
lands under (1) the Act of June 11, 1906, (2) under
the mining laws, and (3) under the coal land
laws. In connection with these claims it is the duty
of the Forest Service to examine them, but the determination
of questions involving title is within the
jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of the Forest Service to protect
the lands of the United States within the National
Forests from acquisition by those who do not seek
them for purposes recognized by law. When it is
apparent that an entry or a claim is not initiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in good faith and in compliance with the spirit of
the law under which it was asserted, but is believed
from the facts to be a subterfuge to acquire title
to timber land, or to control range privileges, water,
a water-power site, or rights of way; or if it otherwise
interferes with the interests of the National
Forests in any way, the Forest Service recommends
a contest, even if the technical requirements of the
law appear to have been fulfilled. It is bad faith,
for instance, to hold a mining or agricultural claim
primarily for the timber thereon or to acquire a
site valuable for water power development.</p>

<p><i>The National Forest Homestead Act.</i> At the
present time there is very little, if any, fraud connected
with the Forest Homestead Act because the
land is classified before it is opened to entry. The
greater part of the work dealing with fraudulent
claims is a relic of the old régime. Before the Forests
were established many Homestead and Timber
and Stone entries were made for the purpose of
securing valuable timber. A large number of persons
resorted to settlement in order to secure the
preference right. It was the common custom in
those days for land cruisers to locate men on heavily
timbered land either before or immediately after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
survey and before the filing of the plats and the
opening of the land to entry. A cabin would be
built upon the land and some unsubstantial improvements
made. When the National Forests
were created they contained great numbers of these
squatters' cabins. Many were abandoned but others
attempted to secure title. Under the old Timber
and Stone Act timber could be secured for $2.50
per acre, but the National Forests are not subject
to entry under this act. So as a last resort the
squatters tried to prove up on the land under the
Homestead law. When the Forests were created
the Service found a great many of these fraudulent
claims on their books, many of which were being
brought up annually for patent. Between December,
1908, and June 30, 1913, a total of 498 entries
for National Forest land were canceled in a single
administrative district. These entries represented
fraudulent efforts to secure title to 85,906 acres of
National Forest land for speculative purposes, involving
nearly a billion feet of merchantable timber.
During the fiscal year 1913 alone 300,000,000
board feet of merchantable timber in one district
was retained in public ownership primarily because
the Forest officers brought out the facts. The lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in all cases were covered with heavy stands of timber,
very small portions of the land had been
cleared, the claimant's residence on the land was not
in compliance with the law, seldom was any crop
raised on the land, and the claimant in other ways
did not carry out the intent of the law.</p>

<p>The Act of June 11, 1906, known as the National
Forest Homestead Act, provides for the acquisition
by qualified entrymen of agricultural lands within
National Forests. The Act is in effect an extension
of the general provisions of the Homestead
laws to the agricultural lands within the National
Forests, with the essential difference that the land
must be classified by the Secretary of Agriculture
as chiefly valuable for agriculture.</p>

<p>This Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture
in his discretion to examine and ascertain,
upon application or otherwise, the location and extent
of lands both surveyed and unsurveyed in the
National Forests, chiefly valuable for agriculture,
which may be occupied for agricultural purposes
without injury to the National Forests or public interests.
He is authorized to list and describe such
lands by metes and bounds or otherwise and to file
such lists and descriptions with the Secretary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Interior for opening to entry in accordance with
the provisions of the Act. Agricultural lands
listed by the Secretary of Agriculture are opened
by the Secretary of the Interior to homestead entry
in tracts not exceeding 160 acres at the expiration
of 60 days from the filing of the lists in the local
Land Office. Notice of the filing of the list is
posted in the local Land Office and is published for
a period of not less than four weeks in a local newspaper.
The Act provides that the person upon
whose application the land is examined and listed,
if a qualified entryman, shall have the preference
right of entry. To exercise this preference right,
application to enter must be filed in the local Land
Office within 60 days after the filing of the list in
that office. The entryman can perfect his title to
the land within a certain period of years by fulfilling
certain conditions of residence and cultivation.</p>

<p>By the Act of June 6, 1912, known as the "Three
Year Homestead Act," the period of residence
necessary to be shown in order to entitle a person to
patent under the Homestead laws is reduced from
5 to 3 years and the period within which a homestead
entry may be completed is reduced from 7 to
5 years. The new law requires the claimant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
cultivate not less than 1/16 of the area of his entry
beginning with the second year of entry and not
less than 1/8 beginning with the third year and until
final proof, except that in the case of the enlarged
Homestead laws, double the areas given are required.
On a 160-acre claim, therefore, it is required
that 1/8 or 20 acres be under cultivation. A
mere breaking of the soil does not meet the requirements
of the statute, but such breaking of the soil
must be accompanied by planting and sowing of
seed and tillage for a crop other than native grasses.
The period within which the cultivation should be
made is reckoned from the date of the entry. The
Secretary of the Interior, however, is authorized
upon a satisfactory showing therefor to reduce the
required area of cultivation on account of financial
disabilities or misfortunes of the entryman or on
account of special physical and climatic conditions
of the land which make cultivation difficult. The
entryman must establish an actual residence upon
the land entered, 6 months after the date of the
entry. After the establishment of residence the
entryman is permitted to be absent from the land
for one continuous period of not more than 5
months in each year following. He must also file<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
at the local Land Office notice of the beginning of
such intended absence.</p>

<p><i>The Mining Laws.</i> Mineral deposits within
National Forests are open to development exactly
as on unreserved public land. A prospector can
go anywhere he chooses and stake a claim wherever
he finds any evidences of valuable minerals. The
only restriction is that mining claims must be bona
fide ones and not taken up for the purpose of acquiring
valuable timber or a town or a water power
site, or to monopolize the water supply of a stock
range. Prospectors may obtain a certain amount
of National Forest timber free of charge to be used
in developing their claims. More than 500 mining
claims are patented within the National Forests
every fiscal year.</p>

<p>A good example of mining claims located for
fraudulent purposes were those located on the rim
and sides of the Grand Canyon in Arizona to prevent
the people from gaining free access to the
canyon and make them pay to enter it. These
claims were shown to be fraudulent since no deposits
of any kind were ever found on them. They
were canceled by the higher courts and the land
reverted to the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
<i>Coal-Land Laws.</i> Coal lands are mineral lands
and as such are subject to entry the same as other
mineral lands in the National Forests.</p>

<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE USE OF NATIONAL FOREST LANDS</h3>

<p>Lands within National Forests may be selected
for administrative uses such as Supervisor's and
Ranger's headquarters, gardens, pastures, corrals,
planting or nursery sites or rights-of-way. These
administrative sites are necessary for the present
and probable future requirements of the Forest
Service for fire protection and the transaction of
business on the National Forests.</p>

<h3>WATER POWER, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH, AND POWER TRANSMISSION LINES</h3>

<p>Along the streams within the National Forests
are many sites suitable for power development.
These are open to occupancy for such purposes and
have the advantage of being on streams whose headwaters
are protected. The aggregate capacity of
the water power sites on the National Forests is
estimated at 12,000,000 horsepower.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Government does not permit the monopolization
of power in any region or allow sites to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
held for speculative purposes. The objects of the
regulations are to secure prompt and full development
and to obtain a reasonable compensation for
the use of the land occupied and the beneficial protection
given the watershed.</p>

<p>Permits for power development on the National
Forests usually run for a term of 50 years and may
be renewed at their expiration upon compliance
with the regulations then existing. Such permits,
while granting liberal terms to applicants, contain
ample provision for the protection of the public
interests.</p>

<p>Applications for power permits are filed with the
District Forester of the Forest Service District in
which the desired site is located. Preliminary permits
are issued to protect an applicant's priority
against subsequent applicants until he has had an
opportunity to study the proper location and design
of the project and to obtain the data necessary
for the final application. Operation is allowed
under the final permit only. The permittee is required
to pay an annual rental charge under the
preliminary and final power permits and definite
periods are specified for the filing of the final application,
beginning of construction and of operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
The rental charges are nominal in amount, the
maximum being about 1/16 of a cent per kilowatt
hour. The amount of annual payment for transmission
lines is $5.00 for each mile or fraction
thereof if National Forest land is crossed by the
line. No rental charges are made for small power
projects (under 100 horsepower capacity), or for
transmission lines used in connection therewith, or
for transmission lines which are part of a power
project under permit or for any power project in
which power is to be used by a municipal corporation
for municipal purposes.</p>

<p>The Secretary of Agriculture has authority to
permit the use of rights-of-way through the National
Forests for conduits, reservoirs, power
plants, telephone and telegraph lines to be used for
irrigation, mining, and domestic purposes and for
the production and transmission of electric power.
No rental charges are made for the telephone and
telegraph rights-of-way, but the applicant must
agree to furnish such facilities to Forest officers and
to permit such reasonable use of its poles or lines
as may be determined or agreed upon between the
applicant and the District Forester.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
